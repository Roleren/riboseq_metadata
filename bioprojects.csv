PRJNA1019689,"Gene expression data in total mRNA and light and heavy polysome fractions from human SKMEL28 melanoma cell line shCont, shp16","p16/CDKN2A is a critical cell cycle regulator and tumor suppressor that is lost in ~50% of all human cancers. Recent studies have identified roles of p16 outside of the cell cycle. Understanding the fundamental biology of p16 loss in cancer may provide novel targets to exploit for therapy. Overall design: To investigate the transcriptonal and translational differences upon p16 loss, we knocked down p16 in SKMEL28 human melanoma cell lines. We isolated total mRNA and fractionated light (0-2) and heavy (>2) ribosome fractions. All samples were done in triplicate. Comparative gene expression profiling analysis for SKMEL28 shGFP (control) and shp16."
PRJDB16512,Mettl1-dependent m7G tRNA modification is essential for maintaining spermatogenesis and fertility in Drosophila melanogaster,"N7-methylguanosine (m7G) in the variable loop region of tRNA is catalyzed by METTL1/WDR4 heterodimer and stabilizes target tRNA. Here, we reveal essential functions of Mettl1 in Drosophila fertility. Knockout of Mettl1 (Mettl1-KO) lost the elongated spermatids and mature sperm, which was fully rescued by a Mettl1-transgene expression, but not a catalytic-dead Mettl1 transgene. This demonstrates that Mettl1-dependent m7G is required for spermatogenesis. Mettl1-KO resulted in a loss of m7G modification on a subset of tRNAs and a decreased level of tRNA expression. Strikingly, overexpression of the translational elongation factor, EF1alpha1, which can compete with the rapid tRNA decay (RTD) pathway in S. cerevisiae, significantly counteracted the sterility of Mettl1-KO males, supporting a critical role of m7G modification of tRNAs in spermatogenesis. Ribosome profiling showed that Mettl1-KO led to the ribosome stalling at codons decoded by tRNAs that were reduced in expression. Mettl1-KO also significantly reduced the translation efficiency of genes involved in elongated spermatid formation and sperm stability. These findings reveal a developmental role for m7G tRNA modifications and indicate that m7G modification-dependent tRNA stability differs among tissues. Overall design: TRAC-seq were performed to identify the m7G-modified tRNAs using gonads of Mettl1-KO and wild-type flies. Ribosome profiling was conducted to measure the changes in translation of genes related to sperm development using testes of Mettl1-KO and wild-type male flies."
PRJNA1015631,GTPBP8 is essential for mitoribosome formation in human mitochondria,"Mitochondrial gene expression relies on mitoribosomes to translate mitochondrial mRNAs. The biogenesis of mitoribosomes is an intricate process involving multiple assembly factors. Among these factors, GTP-binding proteins (GTPBPs) play crucial roles. In bacterial systems, numerous GTPBPs are required for ribosome subunit maturation, with EngB being a GTPBP involved in the ribosomal large subunit assembly. In this study, we focused on exploring the function of GTPBP8, the human homolog of EngB. We found that ablation of GTPBP8 leads to the inhibition of mitochondrial translation, resulting in significant impairment of oxidative phosphorylation. In the absence of GTPBP8, numerous mitoribosomal proteins from both subunits become destabilized, indicating GTPBP8's involvement in synchronized subunit assembly. Furthermore, structural analysis of mitoribosomes from GTPBP8 knock-out cells showed the accumulation of mitoribosomal large subunit assembly intermediates that are incapable of forming functional monosomes. Our study highlights the crucial role of GTPBP8 as a component of the mitochondrial gene expression machinery involved in mitoribosome biogenesis. Overall design: The mitochondrial translation was investigated by mitochondrial ribosome profiling (mitoRiboSeq) in two HEK293 cell lines: HEK293 wildtype, GTPBP8 knockout 1"
PRJNA1013070,A high-resolution map of functional  miR-181 target sites in the thymus reveals the role of coding sequence targeting and alternative seed binding,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical post-transcriptional regulators in many biological processes. They act by guiding RNA-induced silencing complexes to miRNA response elements (MREs) in target mRNA, resulting in translational inhibition and/or mRNA degradation. Efficient targeting depends on a combination of biochemically established targeting rules and contextual factors of a given miRNA and cell type. Here, we generated a high-resolution map of miR-181 MREs to define the targeting rules of miRNA miR-181a/b-1 in murine T-cell development. We uncovered a broad array of novel functional targets of miR-181 and demonstrated that miR-181 acts predominantly through RNA destabilization. High-resolution analysis validated the dominance of seed matches. Critically, we also discovered a unique alternative seed match for miR-181 and identified a distinct group of targets controlled by translational inhibition. In conclusion, deep profiling of miRNA MREs in primary cells is critical to expand physiologically relevant miRNA targetomes and helps to establish context-dependent miRNA targeting rules. Overall design: Ribosome footprinting and RNAseq were performed with mouse thymocytes isolated from 3 WT and 3 miR-181a/b-1 KO mice."

PRJNA1012492,Effect of CCK-8s injection (20 ug/kg BW i.p.) on mRNA translational activity in hypothalamic oxytocin neurons of mice fed standard chow or high-fat/high-sugar diet (RiboTag;TRAP),"Oxytocin-expressing paraventricular hypothalamic neurons (PVN^OT neurons) integrate afferent signals from the gut including cholecystokinin (CCK) to adjust whole-body energy homeostasis. However, the molecular underpinnings by which PVN^OT neurons orchestrate gut-to-brain feeding control remain unclear. Here, we show that mice undergoing selective ablation of PVNOT neurons fail to reduce food intake in response to CCK and develop hyperphagic obesity on chow diet. Notably, exposing wildtype mice to a high-fat/high-sugar (HFHS) diet recapitulates this insensitivity towards CCK, which is linked to diet-induced transcriptional and electrophysiological aberrations specifically in PVNOT neurons. Restoring OT pathways in DIO mice via chemogenetics or polypharmacology sufficiently re-establishes CCK?s anorexigenic effects. Lastly, by single-cell profiling, we identify a specialized PVN^OT neuronal subpopulation with increased ?-opioid signaling under HFHS diet, which restrains their CCK-evoked activation. In sum, we here document a novel (patho)mechanism by which PVN^OT signaling uncouples a gut-brain satiation pathway under obesogenic conditions. Overall design: We treated male Oxt-ires-Cre;RiboTag mice with either vehicle or CCK, collected hypothalami 2h post injection, pooled 2-3 tissues per sample, and affinity purified conditionally HA-tagged ribosomes (incl translating mRNA) specifically from oxytocin neurons. We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of immunoprecipitates versus inputs (n=4 per group) from standard chow diet fed mice and inputs only from high-fat/high-sugar diet fed mice (n=4 per group) Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for TRAP (translating ribosome affinity pufification) between vehicle and CCK-treated mice across immunopreciptates per diet.

PRJNA1004256,Genome-wide screens for mitonuclear co-regulators uncover links between compartmentalized metabolism and mitochondrial gene expression,"Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes are assembled from proteins encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. These dual-origin enzymes pose a complex gene regulatory challenge for cells requiring coordinated gene expression across organelles. To identify genes involved in dual-origin protein complex synthesis, we performed FACS-based genome-wide screens analyzing mutant cells with unbalanced levels of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded subunits of Complex IV. We identified novel genes involved in OXPHOS biogenesis, including two uncharacterized genes: PREPL and NME6. We found that PREPL specifically impacts Complex IV biogenesis by acting at the intersection of mitochondrial lipid metabolism and protein synthesis, while NME6, an uncharacterized nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), controls OXPHOS biogenesis through multiple mechanisms reliant on its NDPK domain. First, NME6 forms a complex with RCC1L, which together perform NDPK activity to maintain local mitochondrial pyrimidine triphosphate levels essential for mitochondrial RNA abundance. Second, NME6 modulates the activity of mitoribosome regulatory complexes, altering mitoribosome assembly and mitochondrial RNA pseudouridylation. Taken together, we propose that NME6 acts as a link between compartmentalized mitochondrial metabolites and mitochondrial gene expression. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and total RNA-sequencing in control and NME6 KO K562 cells"
PRJNA1002994,The IGF2BP3-COPS7B axis facilitates mRNA translation to drive colorectal cancer progression,"Many studies have provided valuable information about genomic and transcriptomic changes that occur in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, protein abundance cannot be reliably predicted by DNA alteration or mRNA expression, which can be partially attributed to post-transcriptional and/or translational regulation of gene expression. In this study, we identified increased translational efficiency (TE) as a hallmark of CRC by evaluating the transcriptomic and proteomic features of CRC patients, along with comparative transcriptomic and ribosome-protected mRNA analysis in colon epithelial cells and colon cancer cells. COPS7B was among the key genes that consistently showed both significant TE increase and protein elevation without transcriptional alteration in CRC. IGF2BP3 enhanced the TE of COPS7B mRNA to promote CRC growth and metastasis. COPS7B was found to be a component of the ribo-interactome that interacted with ribosomes to facilitate ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation initiation. Collectively, this study revealed the proteomic features of CRC and highlighted elevated mRNA translation as a hallmark of CRC. The identification of the  IGF2BP3-COPS7B axis underlying the increased protein synthesis rate in CRC provided a  promising therapeutic target to treat this aggressive disease. Overall design: To investigate the TE changes of global mRNAs in three colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, HCT15 and SW620) compared with colon epithelial cells (841-CON) respectively through Ribo-seq"

PRJNA994502,The translational landscape of direct cardiac reprogramming reveals a role of Ybx1 in repressing cardiac fate acquisition [scRNA-seq],"Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) holds great promise for heart regeneration. Although great progress has been made in understanding the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of iCM reprogramming, its translational regulation remains largely unexplored. Here we characterized the translational landscape of iCM reprogramming using integrative ribosome and transcriptomic profiling, and showed extensive translatome re-patterning during fibroblast conversion into iCM. Loss of function screening for translational regulators uncovered Ybx1 as a critical barrier to iCM induction. Knockdown of Ybx1 dramatically improved the efficiency and quality of iCM reprogramming. Mechanistically, Ybx1 directly bound the transcripts of Srf and Baf60c, both of which mediated, at least partially, the repressive effect of Ybx1 on iCM generation.and Depletion of Ybx1 de-repressed the translation of its targets including SRF and Baf60c. Interestingly, upon removing Ybx1, Tbx5 alone could reprogram fibroblasts into iCMs that exhibit classic iCM molecular features and reprogramming trajectories revealed by our single cell dual-omics. In sum, we presented here a global view of translatome dynamics of cardiac reprogramming and identified a novel translational barrier, Ybx1, to iCM generation. Removing this barrier allowed the single factor mediated iCM reprogramming. Overall design: Single-cell RNA-seq profiles of T+shNT and T+shYbx1 infected  fibroblast were generated at day 12 post infection by 10x Genomics Chromium System."
PRJNA990964,Transcriptome and translatome comparison of tissues from Arabidopsis thaliana,"Translation is one of the multiple complementary steps that orchestrates gene activity. In contrast to the straightforwardness of transcriptional surveys, genome-wide profiles of the translational landscape of plant cells remain technically challenging and are less well explored. Protein-coding genes are expressed at a variable degree of efficiency, resulting in pronounced discordance among the regulatory levels that govern gene activity. Ribo-Seq provides an extremely useful tool for estimating translation efficiency, but limited data sets are available for plants. Here, we provide comparative inventories of expressed and translated RNA populations, generated by mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and ribosome footprinting (Ribo-Seq) of shoots and roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Our data set provides information on the translational fitness of protein-coding mRNAs and lncRNAs that may aid in obtaining a comprehensive picture of the regulatory levels governing genes activity across the genome."
PRJEB54638,Ribosome profiling of the genome-reduced bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae,"In order to study quantitatively the translation efficiency in the genome-reduced bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae, we performed ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) in standard growth conditions. We first tested whether the ribosome profiling method could be applied to M. pneumoniae and assessed the quality of the obtained data. Mpn present some characteristics that differ from other model bacterial species where ribosome profiling has been established, like the absence of a cell wall, different lipid composition and low number of ribosomes (200-300 per cell compared with ~55,000 in E. coli). Thus, several aspects of the original method (Ingolia et al., 2009) had to be adapted. As a reference, we also performed ribosome profiling in E. coli. We also calibrated the ribosome P-site shift from the 3' end of ribosome protected footprints (RPFs) by analyzing the metagene profile of a sample treated with tetracycline."
PRJNA985729,Essential roles of RNA cap-proximal ribose methylation in mammalian embryonic development and fertility,"Eukaryotic RNA pol II transcripts are capped at the 5' end by the methylated guanosine (m7G) moiety. In higher eukaryotes, CMTR1 and CMTR2 catalyse cap-proximal ribose methylations on the first (cap1) and second (cap2) nucleotides, respectively. These modifications mark RNAs as 'self', blocking the activation of the innate immune response pathway. Here we show that loss of mouse Cmtr1 or Cmtr2 leads to embryonic lethality, with non-overlapping sets of transcripts being regulated, without activation of the interferon pathway. In contrast, Cmtr1 mutant adult mouse livers exhibit a chronic activation of the interferon pathway, with multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) being expressed. Conditional deletion of Cmtr1 in the male germline leads to infertility, while global translation is unaffected in the Cmtr1 mutant mouse liver and human cells. Thus, mammalian cap1 and cap2 modifications have an essential role in embryonic gene regulation that is independent of their established role in evading the innate immune system. Overall design: RNA sequencing was applied to study the gene expression differences between Cmtr1+/+ and Cmtr1-/- mouse embryos (E6.5 and E7.5), Cmtr1+/loxP; AlbCreERT2+/- (control) and Cmtr1-/loxP; AlbCreERT2+/- (Cmtr1 cKO) mouse livers, CMTR1+/+ and CMTR1-/- HAP1 cells, Cmtr2+/+ and Cmtr2-/- mouse embryos (E6.5 and E7.5). Ribosome profiling was used to assess translation efficiency differences between Cmtr1+/loxP; AlbCreERT2+/- (control) and Cmtr1-/loxP; AlbCreERT2+/- (Cmtr1 cKO) mouse livers, CMTR1+/+ and CMTR1-/- HAP1 cells."
PRJNA982760,A snoRNA–tRNA modification network governs codon-biased cellular states [RNAseq & Riboseq],"The dynamic balance between tRNA supply and codon usage demand is a fundamental principle in the cellular translation economy. However, the regulation and functional consequences of this balance remain unclear. Here, we use PARIS2 interactome capture, structure modeling, conservation analysis, RNA–protein interaction analysis, and modification mapping to reveal the targets of hundreds of snoRNAs, many of which were previously considered orphans. We identify a snoRNA–tRNA interaction network that is required for global tRNA modifications, including 2'-O-methylation and others. Loss of Fibrillarin, the snoRNA-guided 2'-O-methyltransferase, induces global upregulation of tRNA fragments, a large group of regulatory RNAs. In particular, the snoRNAs D97/D133 guide the 2'-O-methylation of multiple tRNAs, especially for the amino acid methionine (Met), a protein-intrinsic antioxidant. Loss of D97/D133 snoRNAs in human HEK293 cells reduced target tRNA levels and induced codon adaptation of the transcriptome and translatome. Both D97/D133 single and double knockouts in HEK293 cells suppress Met-enriched proliferation-related gene expression programs, including, translation, splicing, and mitochondrial energy metabolism, and promote Met-depleted programs related to development, differentiation, and morphogenesis. In a mouse embryonic stem cell model of development, knockdown and knockout of D97/D133 promote differentiation to mesoderm and endoderm fates, such as cardiomyocytes, without compromising pluripotency, consistent with the enhanced development-related gene expression programs in human cells. This work solves a decade-old mystery about orphan snoRNAs and reveals a function of snoRNAs in controlling the codon-biased dichotomous cellular states of proliferation and development. Overall design: To investigate the novel functions of snoRNAs that guide 2'-O-methylation (Nm) modifications on tRNAs, we established SNORD97, SNORD133 single and double knock out HEK293 and mESCs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we also generated FBL and DKC1 knock down HEK293 cells by siRNAs. Total RNA sequencing was performed to analyze comparative gene expression profiles. Small RNA sequencing was performed to analyze the tRNA fragmentation after loss of the snoRNA-guided 2'-O-methylation modifications on tRNA. Ribosome profiling sequencing (ribo-seq) was performed to analyze the cause of reduced translation after CRISPR knockout of the D97/D133 family of snoRNAs,"

PRJNA978024,RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase METTL3 drives NAFLD-HCC and is a therapeutic target for boosting immunotherapy [m6A-seq],"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism and target therapy on NAFLD-HCC are still unclear. Here, we identify that the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase METTL3 promotes NAFLD-HCC. Hepatocyte-specific Mettl3 knockin exacerbated NAFLD-HCC formation while Mettl3 knockout exerted an opposite effect in mice. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed that METTL3 suppressed antitumor immune response by reducing infiltration of Gzmb+ and IFN-?+ CD8+ T-cell, thereby facilitating immune escape. Mechanistically, METTL3 mediates SCAP mRNA m6A to promote its translation, leading to the activation of cholesterol biosynthesis. This enhanced secretion of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters, lipotoxins that impaired CD8+ T cell function in tumor microenvironment. Targeting of METTL3 by sgRNA, nanoparticle-siRNA, or pharmacological inhibitor (STM2457) in combination with anti-PD1 synergized to reinvigorate cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and mediate tumor regression. Together, METTL3 is a therapeutic target in NAFLD-HCC, especially in conjunction with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Overall design: To investigate the function of METTL3 in NAFLD-HCC, we established shMETTL3 in HKCI2 cell line, then performed RNA-seq, m6A-seq and ribo-seq"

PRJDB12336,Ribosome profiling analyses on WT and RRFTs strain,"In the early stage of translation elongation, peptidyl-tRNA (pep-tRNA) with short nascent chain frequently dissociates from the ribosome (pep-tRNA drop-off). Inactivation of PTH (peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase) causes rapid accumulation of pep-tRNAs and depletion of aminoacyl(aa)-tRNAs, leading to defective protein synthesis. We established a highly sensitive method for direct profiling of pep-tRNAs accumulated in the cell and identified more than 700 peptide sequences of the pep-tRNAs. In this experiment, to examine the involvement of RRF in pep-tRNA drop-off in the early elongation stage, we performed ribosome profiling of WT and temperature-sensitive RRF strain incubated at 43Â°C for 30 min."

To characterize codon preference at the drop-off sites for the pep-tRNAs, we carried out RNA-seq on the PTH deficient cells to obtain the transcriptome profile."
PRJEB51486,Decoding bacterial virulence with high-definition ribosome profiling,"Decades of research have provided significant insight into the physiology, metabolism and virulence of the model intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium).  The use of global RNA quantification studies has provided important information on the transcript behaviour of bacterial pathogens. However, despite transcription and translation being closely linked in prokaryotes, transcriptional levels are often not well correlated with protein abundances. Ribosome profiling (RiboSeq), which involves the deep-sequencing of ribosome protected fragments, is a powerful method to monitor in vivo global translation.  Here, we performed high definition ribosome profiling of S. Typhimurium. We introduced methodological modifications to further decrease rRNA contamination and, importantly obtained clear triplet phasing in read mapping positions, reflecting the triplet periodicity of decoding. We showed that a substantial proportion of S. Typhimurium protein synthesis is dedicated to virulence factor expression, and translational control plays a fundamental role in ensuring appropriate components are expressed at the correct stoichiometric ratios. We found that translational efficiency is mainly determined at the level of initiation by the strength of the Shine-Dalgano sequence's interaction with 16S rRNA and its distance to the initiation codon, the presence of an adenosine 3 nt upstream of the initiation codon, and a lack of RNA structure around the initiation site. Our study identified the underlying importance of translational regulation in bacterial gene expression and virulence."
PRJNA967742,Circadian ribosome profiling reveals a role for the Period2 upstream opening reading frame in sleep.,"Many mammalian proteins have circadian cycles of production and degradation, and many of these rhythms are altered post-transcriptionally. We used ribosome profiling to examine post-transcriptional control of circadian rhythms by quantifying RNA translation in the liver over a 24-h period from circadian-entrained mice transferred to constant darkness conditions and by comparing ribosome binding levels to protein levels for 16 circadian proteins. We observed large differences in ribosome binding levels compared to protein levels, and we observed delays between peak ribosome binding and peak protein abundance. We found extensive binding of ribosomes to upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in circadian mRNAs, including the core clock gene Period2 (Per2). An increase in the number of uORFs in the 5'UTR was associated with a decrease in ribosome binding in the main coding sequence and a reduction in expression of synthetic reporter constructs. Mutation of the Per2 uORF increased luciferase and fluorescence reporter expression in 3T3 cells without altering the phase or period and increased luciferase expression in PER2:LUC MEF cells. Mutation of the Per2 uORF in mice increased PER2 protein levels and reduced total sleep time compared to that in wild-type mice. These results suggest that post-transcriptional processes shape translation of mRNA transcripts, which can impact physiological rhythms and sleep. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing of three C57BL/6N mouse livers from wild-type and Per2uORF mutant mice"
PRJNA967640,Dysregulation of amino acid metabolism upon rapid depletion of cap-binding protein eIF4E [RNA-Seq],"Protein synthesis is metabolically costly, and the level of translation must match nutrient availability and cellular needs. Overall protein synthesis levels are modulated by regulating translation initiation. The cap-binding protein eIF4E—the earliest contact between mRNAs and the translation machinery—serves as one point of control, but its contributions to mRNA-specific translation regulation remain poorly understood. We acutely depleted eIF4E, which is essential in budding yeast, and observed surprisingly modest effects on cell growth and protein synthesis. Long-lived transcripts were downregulated, likely reflecting accelerated turnover, and the strongest gene-specific effects arose as secondary effects of reduced protein biosynthesis on amino acid pools. Futile cycles of amino acid synthesis and degradation were accompanied by translational activation of GCN4, which is typically induced by amino acid starvation. We further identified translational tuning of PCL5, a negative regulator of Gcn4, that provides a consistent protein-to-mRNA ratio under varying translation environments. This translational control depended in part on a uniquely long poly-(A) tract in the PCL5 5' UTR and on poly-(A) binding protein. These results highlight the intricate interplay between translation, amino acid homeostasis, and gene regulation and uncover new layers of feedback control in cellular response to stress and nutrient availability. Overall design: To determine the impact of reduced eIF4E levels on ribosome occupancy transcriptome-wide, we established a eIF4E-AID (auxin inducible degron) yeast strain. We then depleted eIF4E by adding IAA for either 1 or 8 hours. We determined changes in translation and RNA abundance by ribosome profiling and RNA-seq, respectively. A DMSO treated sample was used as a control and both conditions (IAA and DMSO) were performed in duplicate."

PRJNA966986,Microglial MHC-I induction with aging and Alzheimer’s is conserved in mouse models and humans,"Major Histocompatibility Complex I (MHC-I) CNS cellular localization and function is still being determined after previously being thought to be absent from the brain. MHC-I expression has been reported to increase with brain aging in mouse, rat, and human whole tissue analyses. Neuronal MHC-I has been proposed to regulate developmental synapse elimination and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report that across newly generated and publicly available ribosomal profiling, cell sorting, and single-cell data, microglia were the primary source of classical and non-classical MHC-I in mice and humans. Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP)-qPCR analysis of 3-6 and 18-22 month old (m.o.) mice revealed significant age-related microglial induction of MHC-I pathway genes B2m, H2-D1, H2-K1, H2-M3, H2-Q6, and Tap1 but not in astrocytes and neurons. Across a timecourse (12-23 m.o.), microglial MHC-I gradually increased until 21 m.o. and then accelerated. MHC-I protein was also enriched in microglia and increased with aging. Microglial expression, and absence in astrocytes and neurons, of MHC-I binding Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like (Lilrs) and Paired immunoglobin-like type 2 (Pilrs) receptor families could enable cell-autonomous MHC-I signaling and increased with aging in mice and humans. Increased microglial MHC-I, Lilrs, and Pilrs were observed in AD mouse models and human AD data is evident across numerous mouse models, methods, and studies. MHC-I expression correlated with p16INK4A, suggesting an association with cellular senescence. Conserved induction of MHC-I, Lilrs, and Pilrs with aging and AD opens the possibility of cell-autonomous MHC-I signaling to regulate microglial reactivation with aging and neurodegeneration.

PRJNA957283,Human SAMD9 is a Virus-Activatable Anticodon Nuclease Inhibiting Codon-Specific Protein Synthesis,"Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are one of the most conserved components of protein synthesis machinery. An effective strategy for microbes to defend against viruses or competitors is to employ anticodon nucleases (ACNases) to deplete essential tRNAs and thereby shut off global protein synthesis, but this strategy has not been observed in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we report that human SAMD9 is a virus-activatable ACNase that specifically depletes phenylalanine tRNA (tRNAPhe), causing codon-specific ribosomal pausing and inducing stress signaling. SAMD9 ACNase can be activated by poxvirus infection or by SAMD9 mutations associated with a spectrum of developmental or immunological disorders, implicating tRNAPhe deficiency as a major toxic effect in these human diseases and suggesting a new therapeutic strategy. The specificity of the ACNase, located to an N-terminal effector domain of SAMD9, is largely determined by a eukaryotic tRNAPhe specific 2'-O-methylation at the wobble position, making eukaryotic tRNAPhe a universal but specific target for SAMD9. The SAMD9 ACNase differs from the microbial ACNases in structure and substrate specificity, suggesting convergent evolution resulted in a universal immune defense strategy targeting tRNAs. Overall design: tRNA-seq, Ribo-seq and RNA-seq. For tRNA-seq, HeLa cells were uninfected or infected with either WT or vK1-C7- VACV for 8 hours. tRNAs were isolated from total RNAs resolved on a denaturing gel, untreated or treated with a tRNA demethylase and subjected to tRNA-seq. For Ribo-seq and RNA-seq,  BT20 cells transduced with SAMD9-R1293W were uninduced or induced for SAMD9-R1293W expression."
PRJNA956972,Germ-cell specific eIF4E1b regulates maternal mRNA translation to ensure zygotic genome activation [Ribo-seq],"Translation of maternal mRNAs is detected before transcription of zygotic genes and is essential for mammalian embryo development. How certain maternal mRNAs are selected for translation instead of degradation and how this burst of translation affects zygotic genome activation remains unknown. Using gene-edited mice, we document that the oocyte-specific eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E family member 1b (eIF4E1b) is the regulator of maternal mRNA expression that ensures subsequent reprogramming of the zygotic genome. In oocytes, eIF4E1b binds to transcripts encoding translation machinery proteins, chromatin remodelers and reprogramming factors to promote their translation in zygotes and protect them from degradation. The protein products are thought to establish an open chromatin landscape in one-cell zygotes to enable transcription of genes required for cleavage stage development. Our results define a program for rapid resetting of the zygotic epigenome that is regulated by maternal mRNA expression and provides new insights into the mammalian maternal-to-zygotic transition. Overall design: Low input ribo-seq profiling using eggs or embryos from Eif4e1b knockout or control female mice containing HA tagged Rpl22."
PRJNA956925,Human SAMD9 is a Poxvirus-Activatable Anticodon Nuclease Inhibiting Codon-Specific Protein Synthesis,"As a defense strategy against viruses or competitors, some microbes employ anticodon nucleases (ACNases) to deplete essential tRNAs, effectively halting global protein synthesis. However, this mechanism has not been observed in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we report that human SAMD9 is an ACNase that specifically cleaves phenylalanine tRNA (tRNAPhe), resulting in codon-specific ribosomal pausing and stress signaling. While SAMD9 ACNase activity is normally latent in cells, it can be activated by poxvirus infection or rendered constitutively active by SAMD9 mutations associated with various human disorders, revealing tRNAPhe depletion as an antiviral mechanism and a pathogenic condition in SAMD9 disorders. We identified the N-terminal effector domain of SAMD9 as the ACNase, with substrate specificity primarily determined by a eukaryotic tRNAPhe-specific 2'-O-methylation at the wobble position, making virtually all eukaryotic tRNAPhe susceptible to SAMD9 cleavage. Notably, the structure and substrate specificity of SAMD9 ACNase differ from known microbial ACNases, suggesting convergent evolution of a common immune defense strategy targeting tRNAs. Overall design: Ribo-seq and RNA-seq of uninfected HeLa cells as well as HeLa cells infected with vK1-C7- and WT VACV. HeLa cells in 2x150 mM dishes were left uninfected or infected with vK1-C7- or WT VACV WR in the absence or presence of AraC (50 ug/ml final) for 8 hours. The cells were treated with cycloheximide (0.1 mg/ml) for 1 min at 37oC.

In this study, we investigate the expression pattern, structure within the ribosome, and effect on protein synthesis of the ribosomal protein paralog 39L (RPL39L). With a novel mass spectrometric approach we quantify the expression of RPL39L in human pluripotent cells, cancer cell lines and tissue samples, and in mouse germ cells. We generate RPL39L knock-out mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines, perform RNA-seq and Ribo-seq, to demonstrate that RPL39L impacts the dynamics of translation, to support the pluripotency and differentiation, spontaneous and along the germ cell lineage. Our study shows that ribosomal protein paralogs provide switchable modular components that can tune translation to the protein production needs of individual cell types."

PRJEB36902,Translation landscape of the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serova Typhimurium,"Many non-typhoidal serovars of Salmonella such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) are the leading cause of food-borne gastroenteritis, resulting in millions of infections each year and sometimes death. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is the most common non-typhoidal Salmonella strain isolated from patients around the world and is used as a mouse model to study bacterial pathogenesis and host-microbe interactions. Furthermore, S. Typhimurium is an important pathogen in livestock animals including chickens and cattle. S. Typhimurium utilises a multitude of virulence factors to reach and invade host cells and for its intracellular survival. However, little is known about the mechanism of protein synthesis of these virulence factors at the codon level. Here, we performed RNA-seq and ribosome profiling. Ribosome profiling allows the global mapping of translating ribosomes on the transcriptome and therefore provides direct measure of protein synthesis."

PRJNA947930,Genome-wide screening reveals metabolic regulation of translational fidelity by cyclic AMP,"Translational quality control is critical for maintaining the accuracy of protein synthesis in all domains of life. Mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and the ribosome are known to affect translational fidelity and alter fitness, viability, stress responses, neuron function, and life span. In this study, we used a high-throughput fluorescence-based assay to screen a knock-out library of Escherichia coli and identified 30 nonessential genes that are critical for maintaining the fidelity of stop-codon readthrough. Most of these identified genes have not been shown to affect translational fidelity previously. Intriguingly, we show that several genes controlling metabolism, including cyaA and guaA, unexpectedly enhance stop-codon readthrough. CyaA and GuaA catalyze the synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP), respectively. Both CyaA and GuaA increase the expression of ribosomes and tRNAs, allowing aminoacyl-tRNAs to compete with release factors and suppress stop codons. In addition, the effect of guaA deletion on stop-codon readthrough is abolished by deleting prfC, which encodes release factor 3 (RF3). Our results suggest that nucleotide and carbon metabolism is tightly coupled with translational fidelity. Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for Escherichia coli BW25113 and its derivative cyaA knockout strain."
PRJNA945876,Genome-wide Translational Response of Candida albicans to Fluconazole Treatment,"Azoles are commonly used for the treatment of fungal infections and the ability of human fungal pathogens to rapidly respond to azole treatment is critical for the development of antifungal resistance. While the role of genetic mutations, chromosomal rearrangements and transcriptional mechanisms in azole resistance has been well-characterized, very little is known about post-transcriptional and translation mechanisms that drive this process. In addition, most previous genome-wide studies have focused on transcriptional responses to azole treatment, and likely serve as an inaccurate proxies due to extensive post-transcriptional and translational regulation. In this study we use ribosome profiling to provide the first picture of the global translational response of a major human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, to treatment with fluconazole, one of the most widely used azole drugs. We identify sets of genes showing significantly altered translational efficiency (TE), including genes associated with a variety of biological processes such as the cell cycle, DNA repair, cell wall/cell membrane biosynthesis, transport, signaling, DNA- and RNA-binding activities and protein synthesis. Importantly, while there are similarities and differences among gene categories that are regulated by fluconazole at the translational vs. transcriptional levels, we observe very little overlap among individual genes controlled by these mechanisms. Our findings suggest that C. albicans possesses distinct translational mechanisms that are important for the response to antifungal treatment, which could eventually be targeted by novel antifungal therapies. Overall design: Examination of gene expression by RNA-seq and Ribo-seq in 1 strain of Candida albicans grown under 2 conditions (YEPD + 1 ug/mL fluconazole at  30°C  (Fluconazole)) and (YEPD + DMSO vehicle only control at 30°C (No drug)).

PRJNA940173,Ribosome rescue factor PELOTA modulates translation start site choice and protein isoform levels of transcription factor C/EBPα [riboprofiling],"Translation initiation at alternative start sites can dynamically control the synthesis of two or more functionally distinct protein isoforms from a single mRNA. Alternate isoforms of the hematopoietic transcription factor C/EBPa produced from different start sites exert opposing effects during myeloid cell development. This alternative initiation depends on sequence features of the CEBPA transcript, including a regulatory upstream open reading frame (uORF), but the molecular basis is not fully understood. Here we identify trans-acting factors that affect C/EBPa isoform choice using a sensitive and quantitative two-color fluorescence reporter coupled with CRISPRi screening. Our screen uncovered a role for the ribosome rescue factor PELOTA (PELO) in promoting expression of the longer C/EBPa isoform, by directly removing inhibitory unrecycled ribosomes and through indirect effects mediated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. Our work provides further mechanistic insights into coupling between ribosome recycling and translation reinitiation in regulation of a key transcription factor, with implications for normal hematopoiesis and leukemiagenesis. Overall design: To determine the impact of reduced PELO levels on ribosome occupancy transcriptome-wide and on a CEBPA, we established a CEBPA fluorescent reporter in K562 cells. We then depleted PELO by sgRNA (CRISPRi). We determined changes in translation on our reporter (and transcriptome-wide) by ribosome profiling using the nucleases, RNAse1 and P1. A nontargeting sgRNA was used as a control and both sgRNA conditions (nontargeting and PELO KD) were performed in triplicate. Samples from each condition and replicate were also taken for matched RNA-seq gene expression analysis."
PRJNA938481,The ubiquitin conjugase Rad6 mediates ribosome pausing during oxidative stress,"Oxidative stress causes K63-linked ubiquitination of ribosomes by the E2 ubiquitin conjugase, Rad6. How Rad6-mediated ubiquitination of ribosomes affects translation, however, is unclear. We therefore performed Ribo-seq and Disome-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and found that oxidative stress caused ribosome pausing at specific amino acid motifs, and this also led to ribosome collisions. However, these redox pausing signatures were lost in the absence of Rad6 but did not depend on the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway. We also found that Rad6 is needed to inhibit overall translation in response to oxidative stress and its deletion leads to increased expression of antioxidant genes. Finally, we observed that the lack of Rad6 leads to changes during translation initiation that affect activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Our results provide a high-resolution picture of the gene expression changes during oxidative stress and unravel an additional stress response pathway affecting translation elongation. Overall design: Gene expression and ribosome pausing analysis of wild-type cells or cells with mutants of HEL2 or RAD6  -/+  hydrogen peroxide by using Ribo-seq, Disome-seq and RNA-seq.

PRJNA936627,Loss of Dnajc21 leads to cytopenia and altered nucleotide metabolism in zebrafish,"Mutations in the DNAJC21 gene were recently described in Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), a bone marrow failure syndrome with high predisposition for myeloid malignancies. To study the underlying biology in hematopoiesis regulation and disease, we generated the first in vivo model of Dnajc21 deficiency using zebrafish. Zebrafish dnajc21 mutants phenocopy key SDS patient phenotypes such as cytopenia, reduced growth and defective ribosome biogenesis. We show that cytopenia results from impaired hematopoietic differentiation and cell proliferation, and is accompanied by an expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during both embryonic and adult hematopoiesis. The introduction of a tp53 point mutation in the dnajc21 mutants results in myelodysplastic syndrome with erythroid dysplasia as early as four months of age. Using transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we show that Dnajc21 regulates various metabolic pathways including nucleotide biosynthesis. Chemical modulation of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway in dnajc21 mutants reveals an association with neutrophil differentiation, suggesting a novel mechanism in dnajc21-mutant SDS biology.

PRJNA933910,Decoding of translation-regulating entities reveals heterogeneous translation deficiency patterns in cellular senescence,"Cellular senescence constitutes a generally irreversible proliferation barrier, accompanied by macromolecular damage and metabolic rewiring. Several senescence types have been identified based on the initiating stimulus, such as replicative (RS), stress-induced (SIS) and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Reduced protein synthesis is considered a senescence hallmark, but whether this trait pertains to various senescence subtypes and if distinct molecular mechanisms are involved remain largely unknown. Here, we analyze large published or experimentally produced RNA-seq and Ribo-seq datasets to determine whether major translation-regulating entities such as ribosome stalling, the presence of uORFs/dORFs and IRES elements may differentially contribute to translation deficiency in senescence subsets. We show that translation-regulating mechanisms may not be directly relevant to RS, however uORFs are significantly enriched in SIS. Interestingly, ribosome stalling, uORF/dORF patterns and IRES elements comprise predominant mechanisms upon OIS, strongly correlating with Notch pathway activation. Our study provides for the first time evidence that major translation dysregulation mechanisms/patterns occur during cellular senescence, but at different rates depending on the stimulus type. The degree at which those mechanisms accumulate directly correlates with translation deficiency levels. Our thorough analysis contributes to elucidating crucial and so far unknown differences in the translation machinery and ribosome biogenesis between senescence subsets.

To test this, we performed ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq in WT, pat1D and pat1Ddhh1D. Further, CAGE-Seq and Rpb1-ChIP Seq were employed to determine their role in decapping mediated degradation of mRNAs Overall design: This study includes total 26 samples, 9 for ribosome profiling from triplicates of WT, pat1D and pat1Ddhh1D; 3 from  triplicates of WT.

PRJNA928320,Boric acid intercepts 80S ribosome migration from AUG-stop by stabilizing eRF1 at the A site,"In response to environmental changes, cells flexibly and rapidly alter gene expression, through translational controls. In plants, the translation of NIP5;1, a boric acid diffusion facilitator, is upregulated through upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that comprise only AUG and stop codons, in response to a shortage of boric acid in the environment. However, the molecular details of how the minimum uORF controls the translation of the downstream main ORF, in a boric acid concentration-dependent manner, have remained unclear. Here, combining ribosome profiling, TCP-Seq, structural analysis with cryo-electron microscopy, and biochemical assays, we showed that the 80S ribosome (80S) assembled at AUG-stop migrates into the subsequent RNA segment, followed by downstream translation initiation, and that boric acid impedes this process by the stable confinement of eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) on the 80S on AUG-stop. Our results provide molecular insight into translation regulation by a minimum and environment-responsive uORF. Overall design: Translation complex profile sequencing (TCP-seq)"
PRJNA927820,METTL3-mediated m6A modification controls splicing factor abundance and contributes to CLL progression [Ribo-seq],"RNA splicing dysregulation is a hallmark of cancers, promoting the onset and progression of disease. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), spliceosome mutations leading to aberrant splicing occur in ~20% of patients. However, the underlying mechanism for splicing defects in spliceosome unmutated CLL cases remains elusive. Through an integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analysis, we discover proteins involved in RNA splicing are post-transcriptionally upregulated in CLL cells, resulting in splicing dysregulation. The abundance of splicing (factors) complexes is an independent risk factor and associated with poor prognosis in CLL. Moreover, increased splicing factor expression is highly correlated with METTL3, an RNA methyltransferase that modifies N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on mRNA. METTL3 is essential for cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and controls splicing factor protein expression in a methyltransferase-dependent manner through m6A modification mediated ribosome recycling and decoding process.  Our results uncover a novel regulatory axis of METTL3 for splicing dysregulation in CLL and highlight m6A modification as a major contributor to spliceosome mutation-independent splicing defects that lead to CLL progression.

PRJNA926981,mRNA-seq of Aspergillus fumigatus RNAi double knockouts,"The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway has evolved numerous functionalities in eukaryotes, with many on display in Kingdom Fungi. RNAi can regulate gene expression, facilitate drug resistance, or even be altogether lost to improve virulence potential in some fungal pathogens. In the WHO fungal priority pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus, the RNAi system is known to be intact and functional. To extend our limited understanding of A. fumigatus RNAi, we performed a multi-condition mRNA-seq analysis comparing expression of several RNAi double knockout mutants with the wild-type strain in conidia and mycelium grown for 24 or 48 hours. The analysis linked the A. fumigatus dicer-like enzymes and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to regulation of conidial ribosome biogenesis. Cumulatively, A. fumigatus RNAi appears to play an active role in defense against double-stranded RNA species alongside a previously unappreciated housekeeping function in regulation of conidial ribosomal biogenesis genes. Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of poly(A) RNA-seq data for double knockouts (??dclA/B, ??ppdA/B, ??rrpA/B) in the RNAi pathway of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia, 24-h-mycelium, and 48-h-mycelium."
PRJNA926480,The stoichiometry of the eIF4F complex is important for the activation of the integrated stress response,"Eukaryotes have evolved independent conserved pathways to regulate translation initiation in response to stress. One is the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) via phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the initiation factor eIF2 by kinases that sense biotic and abiotic stresses. This leads to reduction of initiator ternary complex and hence inhibition of global translation initiation. Paradoxically however, eIF2a phosphorylation promotes the translation of pro-survival effector genes, such as GCN4 in yeast. Complementing the ISR is the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway, whose inhibition leads to sequestration of the initiation factor eIF4E and subsequent inhibition of canonical initiation. Here we probe translational control in the absence of eIF4E by utilizing a temperature-sensitive allele of the factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Intriguingly, we find that loss of eIF4E leads to translation of GCN4. In addition, we find that translation of GCN4 is neither accompanied by eIF2a phosphorylation nor reduction in initiator ternary complex. Our data suggest that when eIF4E levels are depleted, GCN4 translation is de-repressed via a unique mechanism that involves faster scanning by the small ribosome subunit due to increased local concentration of eIF4A. Overall, our findings suggest that the stoichiometry of eIF4F components is key to ribosome dynamics and may play important roles in translational control of gene expression.

Yeast eIF5B has been shown biochemically to facilitate 18S rRNA 3' end maturation during late-40S ribosomal subunit assembly and gate the transition from translation initiation to elongation. But the effects of eIF5B have not been studied at the genome-wide level in any organism, and 18S rRNA 3' end maturation is poorly understood in plants. Arabidopsis HOT3/eIF5B1 was found to promote development and heat-stress acclimation by translational regulation, but its molecular function remained unknown. Here, we show that HOT3 is a late-stage ribosome biogenesis factor that facilitates 18S rRNA 3' end processing and is a translation initiation factor that globally impacts the transition from initiation to elongation. By developing and implementing 18S-ENDseq, we revealed previously unknown events in 18S rRNA 3' end maturation or metabolism. We quantitatively defined new processing hotspots and identified adenylation as the prevalent non-templated RNA modification at the 3' ends of pre-18S rRNAs. Aberrant 18S rRNA maturation in hot3 further activated RNAi to generate RDR1- and DCL2/4-dependent risiRNAs mainly from a 3' portion of 18S rRNA. We further showed that risiRNAs in hot3 were predominantly localized in ribosome-free fractions not responsible for the 18S rRNA maturation or translation initiation defects in hot3. Our study uncovered the molecular function of HOT3/eIF5B1 in 18S rRNA maturation at the late-40S assembly stage and revealed the regulatory crosstalk among ribosome biogenesis, mRNA translation initiation, and siRNA biogenesis in plants.

By developing and implementing 18S-ENDseq, we revealed previously unknown events in 18S rRNA 3' end maturation or metabolism. We quantitatively defined new processing hotspots and identified adenylation as the prevalent non-templated RNA modification at the 3' ends of pre-18S rRNAs. Aberrant 18S rRNA maturation in hot3 further activated RNAi to generate RDR1- and DCL2/4-dependent risiRNAs mainly from a 3' portion of 18S rRNA. We further showed that risiRNAs in hot3 were predominantly localized in ribosome-free fractions not responsible for the 18S rRNA maturation or translation initiation defects in hot3. Our study uncovered the molecular function of HOT3/eIF5B1 in 18S rRNA maturation at the late-40S assembly stage and revealed the regulatory crosstalk among ribosome biogenesis, mRNA translation initiation, and siRNA biogenesis in plants.

PRJNA925168,Arabidopsis HOT3/eIF5B1 constrains rRNA RNAi by facilitating 18S rRNA maturation during translation initiation (Ribo-Seq),"Ribosome biogenesis is essential for protein synthesis in gene expression. Yeast eIF5B has been shown biochemically to facilitate 18S rRNA 3' end maturation during late-40S ribosomal subunit assembly and gate the transition from translation initiation to elongation. But the effects of eIF5B have not been studied at the genome-wide level in any organism, and 18S rRNA 3' end maturation is poorly understood in plants. Arabidopsis HOT3/eIF5B1 was found to promote development and heat-stress acclimation by translational regulation, but its molecular function remained unknown.

PRJNA922087,Circadian clock regulation by compartmentalized protein translation,"Cells exquisitely compartmentalize many biochemical reactions through phase-separated membrane-less organelles. Besides spatial organization, many biological processes are temporally regulated. While both transcription and translation oscillate in a rhythmic manner, the regulatory mechanism of the latter is understudied. Here we report that the translational regulation during circadian cycles is associated with oscillating phase separation controlled by Ataxin-2 and Ataxin-2L. Ataxin-2/2L forms rhythmic condensates through phase separation in the mammalian central clock suprachiasmatic nucleus to selectively concentrate the transcripts of the core clock genes and recruit the mRNA translation machinery. The rhythmic translational activation is abolished in cells and mouse circadian behavior is altered in the absence of Ataxin-2/2L. During aging or neurodegeneration, Ataxin-2/2L form large, irreversible puncta that no longer regulate translation. Overall, our results unveil Ataxin-2/2L's role as the master regulators of rhythmic translation via a oscillating phase-separation, and explained the reason for their dysfunction in disease states. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of U2OS WT, Ataxin-2 KO, Ataxin-2L KO and DKO cells at 4 hours and 12 hours after synchronization with DXMS."

PRJNA918322,Elongation Factor P is important for sporulation initiation,"The universally conserved protein Elongation Factor P facilitates translation at amino acids that form peptide bonds with low efficiency, particularly poly-proline tracts. Despite its wide conservation, it is not essential in most bacteria and its physiological role remains unclear. Here, we show that EF-P affects the process of sporulation initiation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We observe that lack of EF-P delays expression of sporulation-specific genes. Using ribosome profiling, we observe that expression of spo0A, encoding a transcription factor that functions as the master regulator of sporulation, is lower in a ?efp strain as compared to the wildtype. Ectopic expression of Spo0A rescues the sporulation initiation phenotype, indicating that reduced spo0A expression explains the sporulation defect in ?efp cells. Since Spo0A is the earliest sporulation transcription factor, these data suggest that sporulation initiation can be delayed when protein synthesis is impaired. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of wild-type B. subtilis and a strain lacking EFP 15 and 60 minutes after induction of sporulation"

However, it is largely unknown how the information is read by m6A-readers proteins in heart failure. Here we show that the m6A-reader protein Ythdf2 controls cardiac function and identified a novel mechanism how reader proteins control gene expression and cardiac function. Deletion of Ythdf2 in cardiomyocytes in vivo leads to cardiac hypertrophy, reduced heart function and increased fibrosis during pressure overload as well as during aging. Similarly, in vitro the knockdown of Ythdf2 results in cardiomyocyte growth and remodeling. Mechanistically, we identified the eucaryotic elongation factor 2 as a major target of Ythdf2 using cell type specific Ribo-seq data. Our study expands our understanding on the regulatory functions of m6A methylation in cardiomyocytes and how cardiac function is controlled by the m6A reader protein Ythdf2."

PRJNA909785,Dissecting the Arabidopsis/downy mildew interaction by haustoriated cell-specific RNA profiling,"The downy mildew oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, an obligate filamentous pathogen, infect Arabidopsis by forming feeding structures called haustoria inside the host cell. Previous transcriptome analysis revealed host genes specifically induced during infection. However, whole infected tissue-derived RNA profiling may fail to capture the key transcriptional events that may occur exclusively in haustoriated host cells where the pathogen injects virulence effectors to modulate host immunity for successful accommodation. To understand the interaction between Arabidopsis and H. arabidopsidis at the cellular level, we established a new translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) system applicable to pathogen-responsive promoters, enabling haustoriated cell-specific RNA profiling. Among the host genes specifically expressed in H. arabidopsidis-haustoriated cells, we found genes that promote either susceptibility or resistance to the pathogen, providing new insights into the Arabidopsis/downy mildew interaction. We also expect that our new TRAP system could be applicable to several stimulus-specific contexts as well as other plant–pathogen interactions. Overall design: Three-week-old plants were spray-inoculated to saturation with a spore suspension of 1 x 104 conidiospores/ml. Plants were covered with a transparent lid to maintain high humidity (90-100%) conditions in a growth cabinet at 16°C under a 10-h photoperiod for 5 days. RNA sequencing was performed by deep sequencing on Illumina NextSeq 500 using EXPRSS tag-seq protocol (BMC Genomics 2014, 15:341).

PRJEB57800,Mitochondria Ribosome profiling (mitoRiboSeq) of RF1 Knock out cell line,"Freshwater network ecosystems consist of connected lotic and lentic environments within same catchment area. On the example of Plitvice Lakes, we investigated changes in environmental conditions and microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) occurring with downstream flow. Water samples from tributaries, interlake streams, interconnections of the cascading lakes, and the Korana River, the main outflow of system, were characterized using amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS2 genes. Our results reveal different environmental conditions, as well as bacterial and fungal communities prevail between the three stream types within the freshwater network ecosystem. Korana River's communities clustered with interlake stream communities', as it is located downstream from interlake streams. The differences of microbial communities were, also, confirmed along the longitudinal gradient between farthest sampling points. Higher a-diversities of microbial communities found in tributaries when reaching lakes undergo through mass effects and “species sorting” resulting in less diverse communities. A higher impact of environmental parameters (temperature, O2 and Ca2+ concentrations) was on forming microbial communities in interlake streams, systems with longer WRT, in which the tufa barriers are formed. Higher DOC concentrations due to snow melt impacted communities of tributaries. Despite differences between stream types the microbial community of the Plitvice Lakes is proven to be very stable by the core microbiome, comprising the majority of stream's communities. Our findings indicate a microbial community succession along the river-lake continuum of microbial communities across small freshwater network ecosystem with developed tufa barriers."

Escherichia coli has a well characterized regulatory network to induce multiple defense mechanisms against excess of protons. Nevertheless, systemic studies of the transcriptional and translational reprogramming of E. coli to different acidic strengths have not yet been performed. Here, we used ribosome profiling and mRNA sequencing to determine the response of E. coli to pH 7.6, 5.8 and 4.4. Data were analyzed using the high-throughput HRIBO pipeline and previously undetected adaptations of E. coli to acid stress were found including up-regulation of glycerol catabolism and siderophore production, down-regulation of many membrane proteins and regulation by the transcriptional regulators YdeO, MhpR, IscR, and YdcI. Several examples of differential transcriptional and translational regulation of genes were identified as well as potential novel small open reading frames.

PRJEB53855,Co-translational binding of importins to nascent proteins,"Proteostatic mechanism start preventing aggregation already during protein synthesis. Nascent chain chaperones such as TRiC and Ssb act co-translationally on a wide range of substrates. Importins recognize the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of their cargos in the cytosol. They stabilize and protect their cargo from non-native interactions prior to their release into the nucleoplasm. If importins act co-translationally remains unknown. Here, we used selective ribosome profiling to systematically capture interactions of all yeast importins with nascent proteins on a translatome-wide scale. We found that importins bind the nascent chains of a wide range of ribosomal proteins, chromatin remodeling factors, RNA binding proteins and previously uncharacterized cargos. In particular importins that bind to charged patches, may consecutively act with Ssb suggesting a handover between co-translational chaperoning and nuclear import. Our data are a rich resource for understanding nuclear transport and cellular homeostasis."

PRJNA903814,A ubiquitous GC content signature underlies multimodal post-transcriptional regulation by DDX3X,"The road from transcription to protein synthesis is paved with many obstacles, allowing for several modes of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. A fundamental player in mRNA biology, DDX3X is an RNA binding protein that regulates mRNA translation. By monitoring dynamics of mRNA abundance and translation following DDX3X depletion, we observe stabilization of translationally suppressed mRNA. We used interpretable statistical learning models to uncover GC content in the coding sequence as the major feature underlying RNA stabilization. GC content-related mRNA regulation is detectable in other studies, including hundreds of ENCODE datasets and recent work focusing on mRNA dynamics in the cell cycle. We provide further evidence for mRNA stabilization by detailed analysis of RNA-seq profiles in hundreds of samples, including a recently published Ddx3x conditional mouse model exhibiting cell cycle and neurogenesis defects. Our study identifies a ubiquitous feature underlying mRNA regulation and highlights the importance of quantifying multiple steps of the gene expression cascade, where RNA abundance and protein production are often uncoupled.

Translational control is a major regulatory hub in oncogenesis, however its effects on cancer progression remain poorly understood. To address this, we used ribosome profiling to compare genome-wide translation efficiencies of poorly and highly metastatic breast cancer cells and patient-derived xenografts. We developed novel regression-based methods to analyze ribosome profiling and alternative polyadenylation data, and identified HNRNPC as a translational controller of a specific mRNA regulon. Mechanistically, HNRNPC, in concert with PABPC4, binds near to poly(A) signals, thereby governing the alternative polyadenylation of a set of mRNAs. We found that HNRNPC and PABPC4 are downregulated in highly metastatic cells, which causes HNRNPC-bound mRNAs to undergo 3' UTR lengthening and subsequently, translational repression. We showed that modulating HNRNPC expression impacts the metastatic capacity of breast cancer cells in xenograft mouse models. We also found that a small molecule, previously shown to induce a distal-to-proximal poly(A) site switching, counteracts the HNRNPC-PABPC4 driven deregulation of alternative polyadenylation and decreases the metastatic lung colonization by breast cancer cells in vivo.

PRJNA896508,mtRF1 recognises non-canonical stop codons in human mitochondria,"The genetic code that specifies the identity of amino acids incorporated into proteins during protein synthesis is almost universally conserved. Mitochondrial translation deviates from the standard genetic code which includes the reassignment of two arginine codons into stop codons {Jukes, 1993 #438}. Translation termination at these non-canonical stop codons requires a protein factor to release the newly synthesized polypeptide chain, however, the identity of this factor is not known currently{Nadler, 2021 #406}. Here, we used gene editing and ribo-profiling in combination with cryo-electron microscopy to establish that the unusual mitochondrial release factor 1 (mtRF1) detects the non-canonical stop codons. We show that loss of mtRF1 leads to stalling of mitochondrial ribosomes on non-canonical stop codons and consequent reduced translation of cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 that results in decreased mitochondrial respiration. We show that binding of mtRF1 to the decoding center of the ribosome stabilizes a highly unusual distortion in the mRNA conformation and that the ribosomal RNA importantly participates in the specific recognition of the non-canonical stop codons.

PRJNA896364,The ATR-WEE1 module inhibits GCN20-GCN1 to promote the translation of SOG1 to activate replication stress responses,"DNA replication stress seriously threatens genome stability and is a hall marker of cancers. The evolutionarily conserved kinase ATR and WEE1 are essential for the activation of replication stress responses. But the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood. Translational control is an important mechanism to regulate gene expression. However, the roles of translational control in DNA damage responses (DDR) is unknown. Here we show that ATR-WEE1 regulates the translation of SOG1, the master regulator of DNA damage responses in plants. Through genetic screening, we find that loss of GCN20 and GCN1, which functions together to inhibit protein translation, suppresses the hypersensitivity of Arabidopsis atr and wee1 to the replication stress-inducing agent hydroxyurea (HU). Biochemically, WEE1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates GCN20, which is further polyubiquitinated and degraded. Overexpression of GCN20 significantly inhibits the translation of SOG1. Genetically, mutation of SOG1 enhances the sensitivity of wee1 and wee1 gcn20 to HU, and overexpression of SOG1 suppresses the sensitivity of wee1 to HU. These results suggest that ATR-WEE1 inhibits GCN20-GCN1 to promote the translation of SOG1 during replication stress responses. Taken together, our study identifies a novel function of ATR-WEE1, reveals a new regulatory mechanism for SOG1, and links the translation control to DNA damage responses."

However, the action modes and underlying mechanisms of CNBP in NB progression remain largely unknown. We identify CNBP as an independent prognostic factor for poor outcome of neuroblastoma. CNBP exerts oncogenic roles in ribosome biogenesis, tumorigenesis, and aggressiveness. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the oncogenic functions of CNBP, we employed the Illumina HiSeq X Ten as a discovery platform to analyze the transcriptome profiling changes of human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells in response to stable over-expression of CNBP. The results showed that stable over-expression of CNBP led to altered expression of 3524 human mRNAs, including 889 up-regulated genes and 2635 down-regulated genes. Furthermore, we validated the RNA-seq results by real-time RT-PCR with high identity. Overall, our results provided fundamental information about the transcriptomic changes in response to CNBP over-expression in human tumor cells, and these findings will help us understand the pathogenesis of tumor progression.

Cancer cells are constantly exposed to proteotoxic stress associated with alterations in protein production or folding. It remains poorly understood how cancers cope with proteotoxic stress to promote their growth. Here, our data unexpectedly revealed that N-myc regulates the expression of specific components (~5%) of the protein folding machinery at the translational level through the major cap binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E.  Reducing eIF4E levels in mouse models of medulloblastoma blocked tumorigenesis. Importantly, targeting Hsp70, a protein folding chaperone translationally regulated by N-myc, suppressed tumor growth in mouse and human medulloblastoma xenograft models. These findings reveal a previously hidden molecular program that promotes medulloblastoma formation and identify new therapies that may have impact in the clinic. Overall design: Cells were originated from our germline genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) for MYCN-driven medulloblastoma  (GLT1-TRE-MYCN/Luciferase-GTML), in which a human MYCN transgene was targeted to murine hindbrain neural progenitor cells (Swartling et al., 2010). Medulloblastoma cells were treated for three hours with the ATP-site inhibitor Rapalink-1, which blocks the two translation arms, ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and eIF4E cap-binding protein downstream of mTORC1; or rapamycin, an allosteric inhibitor that blocks S6K but not eIF4E signaling. Three replicates were used for each condition. Genome-wide ribosome profiling was performed."
PRJNA887109,Differential ribosome engagement profiling between undifferentiated and neuron-differentiated P19 cells,"Translation is tightly regulated during differentiation. To gain insights into the mechanism regulating translational activity at the transcript level, we performed Ribosome Profiling of undifferentiated and neuron-differentiated P19 cells. Relative changes in translational activity between the undifferentiated and differentiated cells show an increase in the translational activity of the transcripts encoding for ribosomal proteins compared to the rest of the transcriptome. Thus, in this differentiation system, the biogenesis of the translational machinery is tightly controlled at the translational level. Overall design: P19 cells were differentiated into neuronal cells and then lyzed for material collection. Four biological replicates were collected before differentiation (D0), and four biological replicates were collected after six days of differentiation (D6). An RNA-seq library and a Ribosome Protected Fragment (RPF) library were generated for each sample. To estimate the change in ribosome engagement for each transcript between conditions, we compared the ratio of RFP reads to RNA-seq reads per transcript at D6 and D0."

PRJNA885130,Mechanisms of stop codon readthrough mitigation reveal principles of GCN1 mediated translational quality control,"Readthrough into the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the mRNA results in the production of aberrant proteins. Metazoans efficiently clear readthrough proteins, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show in C. elegans and mammalian cells that readthrough proteins are targeted by a coupled, two-level quality control pathway involving the BAG6 chaperone complex and the ribosome collision-sensing protein GCN1. Readthrough proteins with hydrophobic C-terminal extensions are recognized by SGTA-BAG6 and ubiquitylated by RNF126 for proteasomal degradation. Additionally, cotranslational mRNA decay initiated by GCN1 and CCR4/NOT limits the accumulation of readthrough products. Unexpectedly, selective ribosome profiling uncovered a general role of GCN1 in regulating translation dynamics when ribosomes encounter nonoptimal codons, a feature of 3'UTR sequences. Dysfunction of GCN1 results in mRNA and proteome imbalance, increasingly perturbing transmembrane proteins and collagens during aging. These results define GCN1 as a key factor acting during translation in maintaining protein homeostasis. Overall design: Selective Ribo-seq of GCN1 in C.elegans and HEK293 with respective input controls and additional mRNAseq"
PRJNA884646,Cortical wiring by synapse type-specific control of local protein synthesis,"Neurons use local protein synthesis to support their morphological complexity, which requires independent control across multiple subcellular compartments up to the level of individual synapses. Here we identify a signaling pathway that regulates the local synthesis of proteins required to form excitatory synapses on parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons in the mouse cerebral cortex. This process involves regulation of the TSC subunit 2 (Tsc2) by the Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ErbB4), which enables local control of mRNA translation in a cell type-specific and synapse type-specific manner. Ribosome-associated mRNA profiling reveals a molecular program of synaptic proteins downstream of ErbB4 signaling required to form excitatory inputs on PV+ interneurons. Thus, specific connections use local protein synthesis to control synapse formation in the nervous system. Overall design: RNAseq of ribosome-associated RNAs from P15 synaptosomes of MGE-derived interneurons in 4 samples from ErbB4 conditional knockout mice and 4 samples from control mice"
PRJNA883678,Identification and characterization of sugar regulated promoters in Chaetomium thermophilum,"The thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum has been successfully used in the past for biochemical and high resolution structural studies of protein complexes, but subsequent functional analysis of these assemblies were hindered due to the lack of genetic tools in this thermophile, which are typically amenable in several other mesophilic eukaryotic model organisms, in particular the yeast Saccharomycers cerevisiae. Hence, we aimed to develop a regulatable gene-expression system in C. thermophilum, which might facilitate such in vivo studies, based on what we know about the galactose-inducible GAL promoter in yeast. To identify sugar-regulatable promoters in C. thermophilum, we performed comparative xylose- versus glucose-dependent gene expression studies, which uncovered a number of enzymes induced by xylose but repressed by glucose. Subsequently, we cloned the promoters of the two most stringently regulated genes, the xylosidase-like gene (XYL) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH), obtained from this genome-wide analysis in front of the thermostable YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) reporter. In this way, we could demonstrate xylose-dependent YFP expression by either western blotting or life cell imaging fluorescence microscopy. Prompted by these results, we finally expressed a well-characterized dominant-negative ribosome assembly factor mutant, rsa4 E117>D, under the control of the XDH promoter, which allowed us to induce a nuclear export defect of the pre-60S subunit when C. thermophilum cells were grown in xylose but not glucose containing medium. Altogether, our study recognized xylose-regulatable promoters in Chaetomium thermophilum, which may foster functional studies of genes of interest in this thermophilic eukaryotic model organism.  Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for Chaetomium thermophilum cells exposed to glucose (G) or xylose (X) as sole carbon source in comparison to a carbon depleted refernece medium (R)."
PRJNA883055,A rapid protocol for ribosome profiling of low input samples,"Ribosome profiling provides quantitative, comprehensive, and high-resolution snapshots of cellular translation by the high-throughput sequencing of short mRNA fragments that are protected by ribosomes from nucleolytic digestion. While the overall principle is simple, the workflow of ribosome profiling experiments is complex and challenging, and typically requires large amounts of sample, limiting its broad applicability.We established a new protocol for ultra-rapid ribosome profiling from low-input samples. It features a robust strategy for sequencing library preparation within one day that employs solid phase purification of reaction intermediates, allowing to reduce the input to as little as 0.1 pmol of RNA. Hence, it is particularly suited for the analyses of small samples or targeted ribosome profiling.Its high sensitivity and its ease of implementation will foster the generation of higher quality data from small samples, which opens new opportunities in applying ribosome profiling."

We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of 3 different strains at 2 time points. Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for global RPOA-2 depleted strains (degron::GFP::rpoa-2; eft-3p::TIR1, embryo, +IAA), hypodermal RPOA-2 depleted strains (degron::GFP::rpoa-2; col-10p::TIR1, embryo, +IAA),  and control strains (degron::GFP::rpoa-2, embryo, -IAA)."

PRJEB53197,"Dieter Wolf , Lyrum Larum Ypsum","eIF3, whose subunits are frequently overexpressed in cancer, regulates mRNA translation from initiation to termination, but mRNA-selective functions of individual subunits remain poorly defined. Using multi-omic profiling upon acute depletion of eIF3 subunits, we observed that while eIF3a, b, e, and f markedly differed in their impact on eIF3 holo-complex formation and translation, they were each required for cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. Remarkably, eIF3k showed the opposite pattern with depletion promoting global translation, cell proliferation, tumor growth, and stress resistance through repressing the synthesis of ribosomal proteins, especially RPS15A. Whereas ectopic expression of RPS15A mimicked the anabolic effects of eIF3k depletion, disruption of eIF3 binding to the 5'-UTR of RSP15A mRNA negated them. Our studies suggest eIF3k-l as a mRNA specific module which - through impacting RPS15A mRNA translation - serves as a rheostat of ribosome content to secure spare translational capacity that can be mobilized during stress."
PRJNA876935,Transcriptome-wide profiling of acute stress induced changes in ribosome occupancy level using external standards,"Acute cellular stress is known to induce a global reduction in protein translation through suppression of cap dependent translation. However, selective translation in response to acute stress has been shown to play important roles in regulating the stress response. An accurate transcriptome-wide profile of acute cellular stress-induced translational changes has been challenging to obtain. Commonly used data normalization methods, such as quantile normalization, operate based on the assumption that any systematic shifts are artifacts introduced from experimental procedures. Consequently, if applied to profiling acute cellular stress-induced protein translation changes, these methods are expected to produce biased estimates. To address this issue, here we designed, generated, and evaluated a panel of 16 oligomers to serve as external standards for ribosome profiling studies. Using Sodium Arsenite treatment-induced oxidative stress in lymphoblastoid cell lines as a model system, we applied spike-in oligomers as external standards based on quantifications of monosomal RNA extracted from each sample. We found our spike-in oligomers to display a linear correlation between the observed and the expected, with small but significant ratio compression at the lower concentration range, and span the expected quantitative range in the observed data, which covers 97 % of the quantitated endogenous genes. We found popular global scaling normalization approaches to introduce both high levels of false positives and false negatives in differential expression analysis. Using the expected fold changes constructed from spike-in external controls, we found in our dataset that TMM normalization produced 87.5% false positives when a P value cutoff of 0.1 is used (i.e. 10% expected false positive rate) and on average produced a systematic shift of fold change by 3.25 fold. These results highlight the consequences of applying global scaling approaches to conditions that clearly violate their key assumptions. As an alternative, we found using spike-in quantifications as control genes in RUVg normalization recapitulated the expected stress induced global reduction of translation, and resulted in little, if any, systematic shifts in spike-in constructed true positives. Finally, using spike-in constructed true positives and true negatives, we explored alternative normalization approaches for acute cellular stress response ribo-seq studies. We found that a simple approach that quantile normalized data from control and treated samples separately, which we termed respective quantile normalization, produced expected results in spike-in quantification, and resulted in little, if any, systematic bias on fold change in endogenous genes. Additionally, we found that under certain parameters, using endogenous control genes for RUVg normalization best recapitulate the expected. Our results clearly demonstrated the utility of our spike-in oligomers, both for constructing expected results as controls and for data normalization. Our exploration of different normalization approaches highlights the issues in applying global scaling normalization when key assumptions are clearly not met. We show that a respective quantile normalization approach or normalization with endogenous control genes are viable options worth considering as a more generalizable approach for stress response ribo-seq studies. This conclusion is likely applicable to other types of studies that involve global shifts in expression profiles between comparison groups of interests. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of LCL in response to sodium arsenite induced stress"

PRJNA872203,Transcriptome profiling of Microbacterium resistens MZT7 reveals mechanisms of 17β-estradiol response and biotransformation,"17ß-estradiol (E2) pollution has attracted much attention, and the existence of E2 poses certain risks to the environment and human health. However, the mechanism of microbial degradation of E2 remains unclear. In this study, the location of E2-degrading enzymes was investigated, and transcriptome analysis of Microbacterium resistens MZT7 (M. resistens MZT7) exposed to E2. The degradation of E2 by M. resistens MZT7 was via the biological action of E2-induced intracellular enzymes. With the RNA sequencing, we found 1,109 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among, 773 genes were up-regulated and 336 genes were down-regulated. The results of the RNA sequencing indicated the DEGs were related to transport, metabolism, and stress response. Genes for transport, transmembrane transport, oxidoreductase activity, ATPase activity, transporter activity and quorum sensing were up-regulated. Genes for tricarboxylic acid cycle, ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation and carbon metabolism were down-regulated. These findings provide some new insights into the molecular mechanism of biotransformation of E2 by M. resistens MZT7. Overall design: In this study, we first localized the E2 degrading enzyme. Then we investigated the transcriptional differences between E2-treated and non-E2-treated strain MZT7 by RNA-seq technology to reveal the degradation mechanism and its response to E2 at the transcriptional level."
PRJNA872137,"The Translation Initiation Factor Homolog, eif4e1c, Regulates Cardiomyocyte Metabolism and Proliferation During Heart Regeneration.","The?eIF4E family of translation initiation factors bind 5' methylated caps and act as the limiting-step for mRNA translation. The canonical eIF4E1A is required for cell viability, yet other related families exist and are all utilized in specific contexts or tissues. Here, we describe a new family called Eif4e1c that is ancestral to the canonical eIF4E1A in vertebrates, and for which we find roles during heart development and regeneration in zebrafish.?The Eif4e1c family is present in all aquatic vertebrates but has been lost in all terrestrial species. A core group of amino acids shared over 500 million years of evolution from?ray-finned fish to sharks?forms an evolutionarily conserved binding interface along the surface of the protein, suggesting Eif4e1c functions in a novel pathway.? Deletion of eif4e1c?in zebrafish caused growth deficits and impaired survival in juveniles.?Mutants surviving to adulthood had fewer cardiomyocytes, while also showing reduced proliferative responses to cardiac injury. Ribosome profiling of mutant hearts demonstrated changes in translation efficiency of mRNA for genes known to regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation.

PRJNA870413,PRRC2 proteins are translation factors that promote leaky scanning,"Most animal mRNAs contain upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs). These uORFs represent an impediment to translation of the main ORF since ribosomes usually bind the mRNA cap at the 5' end and then scan for ORFs in a 5'-to-3' fashion. One way for ribosomes to bypass uORFs is via leaky scanning, whereby the ribosome disregards the uORF start codon. Hence leaky scanning is an important post-transcriptional mechanism affecting gene expression. Few molecular factors regulating or facilitating this process are known. Here we identify the PRRC2 proteins PRRC2A, PRRC2B and PRRC2C as translation initiation factors. We find that they bind other eukaryotic translation initiation factors and preinitiation complexes and are enriched on ribosomes translating mRNAs with uORFs. We find that PRRC2 proteins promote translation of mRNAs containing uORFs by facilitating leaky scanning past uORFs. Since PRRC2 proteins have been associated with cancer, this provides a mechanistic starting point for understanding their physiological and pathophysiological roles. Overall design: Selective and total 40S and 80S ribosome footprinting in control versus PRRC2A+B+C knockdown condition. Selective Ribosome footprinting for PRRC2C. Also RNA-seq."
PRJNA868576,Gene and protein sequence features augment HLA class I ligand predictions (ribosome profiling),"The sensitivity of malignant tissues to T cell-based cancer immunotherapies is dependent on the presence of targetable HLA class I ligands on the tumor cell surface. Peptide intrinsic factors, such as HLA class I affinity, likelihood of proteasomal processing, and transport into the ER lumen have all been established as determinants of HLA ligand presentation. However, the role of sequence features at the gene and protein level as determinants of epitope presentation has not been systematically evaluated. To address this, we performed HLA ligandome mass spectrometry on patient-derived melanoma lines and used this data-set to evaluate the contribution of 7,124 gene and protein sequence features to HLA sampling. This analysis reveals that a number of predicted modifiers of mRNA and protein abundance and turn-over, including predicted mRNA methylation and protein ubiquitination sites, inform on the presence of HLA ligands. Importantly, integration of gene and protein sequence features into a machine learning approach augments HLA ligand predictions to a comparable degree as predictive models that include experimental measures of gene expression. Our study highlights the value of gene and protein features to HLA ligand predictions. Overall design: Three different melanoma cell lines were cultered by an approximate density of 80%, subsequently treated with cycloheximide, harvested and snap frozen. Ribosome profling was performed. Please note that each processed data was generated from both replicates and is linked to the corresponding 'replicate 1' sample records."

PRJNA865560,Assessing the impact of boldine on the gastrocnemius using multiomics profiling at 7 and 28 days post-complete spinal cord injury in young male mice [RRBS],"Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in rapid muscle loss in the acute timeframe post-injury. The principal mechanisms of general muscle atrophy have been well-described but there is limited information available specific to SCI. Exogenous drug/small molecule interventions to slow muscle atrophy in severe-to-complete SCI have been relatively ineffective due to the unique combination in loss of central nervous system function due to the spinal lesion, systemic response to the trauma itself, and resultant paralysis. The wide-ranging physiologic response to SCI requires the search for novel therapeutic targets. Connexin hemichannels (CxHCs) allow non-selective passage of small molecules into and out of the cell. Boldine, a CxHC-inhibiting aporphine found in the boldo tree (Peumus boldus), has shown promising results in slowing muscle atrophy and preserving muscle function during endotoxemia-induced sepsis and dysferlinopathy. We administered 50 mg/kg/d of boldine to spinal cord transected mice beginning at day 3 post-injury. Tissue was collected at 7 and 28 d post-injury. Boldine treatment did not alter the loss of body or muscle mass. We then performed molecular analysis at three different levels on the gastrocnemius muscle. Metabolomic analysis revealed that boldine attenuated the SCI-induced changes in proline, phenylalanine, leucine, and isoleucine, as well as glucose, 7 d post-SCI in the gastrocnemius, but not at 28 d. RNA-sequencing further found that SCI resulted in the differential expression of 7,705 and 2,991 genes at 7 and 28 d compared to sham animals, with enrichment for pathways associated with ribosome biogenesis, translation and oxidative phosphorylation. Boldine altered the expression of 146 genes at 7 d and 110 genes at 28 d post-SCI. Additionally, DNA methylation analyses of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing highlighted distinct methylation patterns at both 7 and 28 d following SCI both with and without boldine, though most methylation changes did not associate with genes that were differentially expressed. Taken together, boldine is not an efficacious therapy to preserve body and muscle mass after complete SCI, though boldine was able to preserve or attenuate SCI-induced changes across the metabolome, transcriptome and methylome. Additional research is needed to determine if treatment could be modified or used in combination for long-term recovery or if boldine would be a more efficacious therapy in mild or moderate forms of injury. Overall design: Comparative methylation coverage analysis of RRBS data from gastrocnemius tissue using Sham, SCI, and SCI-boldine mice."

Although its propensity to form condensates has been studied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, the physiological role of PrLD remains unclear. Here, we investigated the physiological role of PrLD in NFAR2, generated by a splicing variant of the Ilf3 gene. Removal of the PrLD in mice affected the chronic water immersion and restraint stress (WIRS)-sensitive nuclear localization of NFAR2 in the amygdala, a fear-related brain region. Since NFAR2 regulates transcription and translation in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively, we investigated the effects of the PrLD deletion and WIRS on gene expression using RNA-seq and ribosome profiling.

PRJNA861982,"Distinct transcriptome, translatome, and proteome reprogramming during the oocyte-to-embryo transition","Oocyte-to-embryo transition plays a critical role in oocyte maturation and embryogenesis. It is a highly regulated process in part due to a transcription silenced period followed by zygotic genome activation. How transcriptome, translatome, and proteome interplay in this critical developmental window remains poorly understood. Utilizing a highly sensitive mass spectrometry, we obtained a high-quality proteome landscape spanning 10 stages, from the mouse full-grown oocyte (FGO) to blastocyst, using 100 oocytes/embryos at each stage. By integrative analysis with corresponding transcriptome and translatome, we found transcription and translation levels can not reflect protein abundance in most cases. From FGO to 4-cell embryos, proteomes are predominated by FGO-produced proteins, while the transcriptome and translatome are much more dynamic. FGO inherited proteins frequently persist after the corresponding transcripts are already downregulated or decayed. Improved concordance between protein and RNA is observed for genes starting translation only upon meiotic resumption (OET upregulated) or transcribed only in embryos, although the detected protein dynamics often lag behind transcription and translation. Concordance between protein and transcription/tranlation is associated with protein half-lives. Finally, a kinetic model well predicts protein dynamics when incorporating both the initial protein abundance in FGO and translation kinetics across developmental stages. In sum, our study reveals multilayer control of gene expression during oocyte maturation and embryogenesis. Overall design: By employing RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, and LC-MS/MS across 10 developmental stages from FGO to blastocyst, we investigated the protein, translation and transcription dynamics during oocyte maturation and early embryo development. We also invetigated the interplay between proteome and translatome or transcriptome."

PRJNA858420,Evasion of antiviral innate immunity by SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 is exerted through H3K9 di-methylation,"The pathogen causing the current COVID-19 pandemic, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), evades the innate immune machinery through the independent action of several viral proteins, including the nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1). NSP1 has multiple functions, but the relative contribution of NSP1-mediated translational repression, ribosome-proximate degradation of host mRNA, or other molecular mechanisms to viral immune evasion remains unclear. Here we combined several genome wide approaches, including RNA-seq, ribosome footprinting, and ChIP-seq to find that NSP1 predominantly affects transcription of immune-related genes. NSP1 expression in A549 cells induced Histone 3 Lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation of antiviral gene loci, leading to specific suppression of type I and type III interferon pathways. Treatment with the G9a/GLP H3K9 methyltransferase inhibitor UNC0638 reverses this suppression of antiviral genes and blocks viral replication after SARS-CoV2 infection of A549 cells. Our results call attention to epigenetic reprogramming induced by SARS-CoV2 and highlight the importance to identify innate factors regulating histone modification of gene loci targeted by SARS-CoV-2, with possible relevance to the understanding and therapy of other immunomodulatory diseases. Overall design: Herin several high throughput approaches including total RNA-Seq, Ribosome footprinting and ChIP-seq are combined to probe NSP1 function. Our results lead us to propose that NSP1 is a multifunctional protein that promotes innate antiviral immune evasion by inducing H3K9 dimethylation. Treatment with the specific H3K9 methyltransferases inhibitor UNC0638 attenuated suppression of antiviral genes by NSP1. In addition, UNC0638 treatment restored antiviral gene expression and blocked viral replication during SARS-CoV2 infection of human lung epithelial cells."

PRJNA858018,RNA sequencing analysis of the amygdala in mouse model of alcohol drinking,"Repeated excessive alcohol consumption is a risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD).  Although AUD has been more common in men than women, women develop more severe behavioral and physical impairments.  However, relatively few new therapeutics targeting development of AUD have been validated.  Here, to gain a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol intake, we conducted a genome-wide RNA-sequencing analysis in female mice exposed to different modes (acute vs chronic) of ethanol drinking.  We focused on transcriptional profiles in amygdala including the central and basolateral subnuclei, brain areas previously implicated in alcohol drinking and seeking.  We found distinct gene expression patterns and canonical pathways induced by both acute and chronic intake.  Surprisingly, both drinking modes triggered similar transcriptional changes, including up-regulation of ribosome-related/translational pathways and myelination pathways, and down-regulation of chromatin binding and histone modification.  Notably, multiple genes that were significantly altered with alcohol drinking, including Atp2b1, Hspa4, Slc4a7, Sbno1, Ubxn2b, Nfkb1, Nts, and Hdac2, had previously been associated with human AUD via GWAS or other genomic studies.  In addition, subsequent analyses of hub genes and upstream regulatory pathways predicted that voluntary ethanol consumption affects epigenetic changes via histone deacetylation pathways, oligodendrocyte and myelin function, and the oligodendrocyte-related transcription factor, Sox17. Overall, our results suggest that the expression of oligodendrocyte-related genes in the central and basolateral subnuclei of the amygdala is sensitive to voluntary alcohol drinking.  These findings suggest potential molecular targets for future therapeutic approaches to prevent the development of AUD, particularly in women, due to repeated excessive alcohol consumption Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis from RNA-seq data collected from the amygdala of mice subjected to acute and chronic alcohol drinking paradigm"

PRJNA854905,Transcriptional and Translational Dynamics of Zika and Dengue Virus Infection,"Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are members of the Flaviviridae family of RNA viruses and cause severe disease in humans. ZIKV and DENV share over 90% of their genome sequences, however the clinical features of Zika and dengue infections are very different reflecting tropism and cellular effects. Here, we used simultaneous RNA sequencing and ribosome footprinting to define the transcriptional and translational dynamics of ZIKV and DENV infection in human neuronal progenitor cells (hNPCs). The gene expression data showed induction of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARS) and the translation-activating PIM1 kinase indicating an increase in RNA translation capacity. The data also reveal activation of different cell stress reponses, with ZIKV triggering a BACH1/2 redox program, and DENV activating the ETF/CHOP endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress program. The RNA translation data highlight activation of polyamine metabolism through changes in key enzymes and their regulators. This pathway is needed for eIF5A hypusination and has been implicated viral translation and replication. Concerning the viral RNA genomes, ribosome occupancy readily identifies highly translated open reading frames and a novel upstream ORF (uORF) in the DENV genome. Together, our data highlight both the cellular stress response and also the activation of RNA translation and polyamine metabolism during DENV and ZIKV infection. Overall design: We performed ribosome footprinting and RNA sequencing on human neuronal progenitor cells (hNPCs) cells either uninfected or infected with ZIKV or DENV  in two biological replicates that were collected 72 hours post infection. Unifected samples are indicated as A1 and B1, ZIKV infected samples are indicated as A2, B2 and DENV infected samples are indicated as A3 and B3."

PRJNA854147,Clockwork orange-mediated control of sugar responsive transcription [cwo mutant],"Feeding on high sugar diet reprograms metabolism, partially mediated through a gene regulatory network controlled by intracellular sugar sensor Mondo/ChREBP-Mlx. Sugar-induced gene expression changes include activation of genes encoding enzymes of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathways, and de novo lipogenesis, collectively driving the flux of sugar-derived carbon into triacylglycerides. These sugar-induced metabolic changes are likely to trigger compensatory responses to avoid depletion of necessary metabolites, but they remain poorly characterized. Through a global temporal clustering analysis of sugar-induced gene expression in Drosophila we identify new gene expression programs controlled by sugar feeding. These include rapid and transient downregulation of ribosome biogenesis genes, known targets of transcription factor Myc. Through in silico motif predictions and experimental validation, we identify transcriptional repressor Clockwork orange (CWO) as a mediator of this response. CWO expression is directly activated by Mondo-Mlx and it counteracts Myc through repression of its expression as well as through binding to overlapping regulatory regions of ribosome biogenesis genes. Loss of CWO function leads to depletion of UDP-GlcNAc pools and impaired viability on high sugar diet. Analysis of CWO orthologs, BHLHE40 and BHLHE41, in mouse hepatocytes revealed a conserved role for BHLHE41 in repressing ribosome biogenesis genes. Collectively, our data uncover a gene regulatory circuit balancing the activities of lipid and protein biosynthesis to maintain homeostasis during high sugar feeding. Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for Cwo mutant in Drosophila larvae in high and low sugar conditions."

PRJNA854095,Ribosome profiling and mRNA seq demonstrate that insertion of common resistance cassettes in yeast drives aberrant transcription,Our study found that insertion of commonly used selection cassettes in yeast can drive aberrant transcription events and disrupt expression of neighboring genes. We performed ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq on yeast strains where ORFs had been replaced with common selection cassettes and observed aberrant transcripts. Aberrant transcripts positioned near adjacent genomic loci repressed protein synthesis of those genes by transcription interference (ablating normal length transcript production) coincident with translation of competitive uORFs on the long transcript which prevented translation of the main ORF seen by ribosome profiling. Overall design: We performed ribosome profiling and matched mRNA-seq on wild-type and dbp1?::KANMX6 yeast of interest and observed the expression of loci near deleted ORFs

We also performed both a whole-genome targeting primary CRISPR screen and a secondary CRISPR screen targeting a currated collection of genes to determine genes important for sensitivity to WIN Site inhibition. These combined data sets rationally guided us in assembling a collection of compounds that, when combined with WIN Site inhibitor, synergistically inhibit growth of MLL-rearranged leukemia cells.

PRJNA850795,DUX4 orchestrates translational reprograming by broadly suppressing translation efficiency [Ribo-seq],"DUX4, an embryonic transcription factor normally silenced in somatic tissues, was recently shown to reduce major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) and promote immune evasion in numerous cancer types. We report that transient expression of DUX4 results in the long-term suppression of interferon-gamma induction of MHC-I and the immunoproteasome. Brief expression of transcriptionally active DUX4 leads to a prolonged decrease in protein synthesis, altering the activity of translation initiation regulators eIF2a, eIF4E, 4EBP1, and translation elongation factor eEF2. Translational profiling identified mRNAs susceptible to DUX4-induced inhibition of translation initiation and elongation, including mRNAs encoding antigen presentation factors. We show that DUX4 orchestrates translational reprogramming by broadly attenuating protein synthesis while inducing the expression of RNAs encoding early embryonic proteins that are translationally up regulated and predicted to be less vulnerable to translational inhibition. Endogenous expression of DUX4 and its target genes in FSHD muscle cells and SuSa germinoma cells also correlates with suppression of protein synthesis and reduced MHC-I presentation. Our findings reveal a novel role of DUX4 in modulating translational control to reshape the cellular translatome with important implications for development and disease.

PRJNA846773,A Legionella toxin mimics tRNA and glycosylates the translation machinery to trigger a ribotoxic stress response.,"Pathogens often secrete proteins or nucleic acids that mimic the structure and/or function of molecules expressed within their host counterparts. Such molecular mimicry empowers pathogens to subvert critical host processes and helps establish infection. We report here that the intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila (L.p.) secretes a toxin named SidI (substrate of icm/dot transporter I) which possesses a transfer RNA (tRNA) like fold and functions as a mannosyl transferase . The 3.1 Å cryo-EM structure of SidI reveals an N-terminal domain that exhibits a characteristic 'inverted L-shape' and charge distribution that is present in two known protein mimics of tRNAs, the bacterial elongation factor EF-G and the mammalian release factor eRF1. In addition, SidI's C-terminal domain adopts a glycosyl transferase B fold and shares considerable homology to a known mannosyl transferase. This molecular coupling of fold and enzymatic function allows SidI to bind and glycosylate components of the host translational apparatus, including the ribosome, resulting in a robust block of protein synthesis that is comparable to the potency exhibited by the toxin ricin. Additionally, we uncovered that the translational pausing activated by SidI elicits a stress response signature reminiscent to the ribotoxic stress response activated by elongation inhibitors that induce ribosome collisions. SidI mediated perturbations to the ribosome activates the stress kinases ZAKa and p38, that in turn drive the accumulation of the protein activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). Intriguingly, ATF3 escapes the translation block imposed by SidI, translocates to the nucleus, and subsequently orchestrates the transcription of stress-inducible genes that culminates in the activation of a cell death program. Thus, using Legionella and its effectors as tools, we have unravelled the role of a ribosome to nuclear signaling pathway that regulates cell fate. Overall design: Expression profiling by RNA-seq of HEK293-FcgR cells infected with either WT or ?dotA Legionella (as a time course) and HEK293T cells treated with ansiomycin or didemnin-B (for 4 hours) with two bioreps for each condition."
PRJNA844064,Arabidopsis mRNA decay landscape shaped by XRN 5′-3′ exoribonucleases,"XRN 5'-3' exoribonucleases play crucial roles in the control of RNA processing, quality, and quantity in eukaryotes. Although genome-wide profiling of RNA decay fragments is now feasible, how XRNs shape the plant mRNA degradome remains elusive. Here, we profiled and analyzed the RNA degradomes of the Arabidopsis wild type and mutants with defects in XRN activity. Deficiency of nuclear XRN3 or cytoplasmic XRN4 but not nuclear XRN2 activity largely altered Arabidopsis mRNA decay profiles. In addition to the primary XRN4 substrates derived from decapping and microRNA-directed slicing, terminating ribosome- and exon junction complex-protected fragments produced from XRN4-mediated cytoplasmic decay also represent the most abundant decay intermediates of Arabidopsis mRNAs. Short excised linear introns and cleaved pre-mRNA fragments downstream of polyadenylation sites were polyadenylated and stabilized in the xrn3 mutant, demonstrating the function of XRN3 in the removal of cleavage remnants from pre-mRNA processing. Further analysis of stabilized XRN3 substrates confirmed that polyadenylation cleavage frequently occurs after an adenosine. An increase in decay intermediates with 5' ends upstream of a consensus motif in the xrn4 mutant suggests an endonucleolytic cleavage mechanism targeting the 3' untranslated region of many Arabidopsis mRNAs. However, analysis of decay fragments stabilized in the xrn4 mutant indicated that, except for microRNA-directed slicing, endonucleolytic cleavage events in the coding sequence might rarely result in major decay intermediates. Together, the results of this study reveal major substrates and products of nuclear and cytoplasmic XRNs along Arabidopsis transcripts and provide a basis for precise interpretation of RNA degradome data. Overall design: Profiling 5' ends of RNA degradation intermediate in Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves by parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE)"
PRJNA844063,Stalled ribosomes are signals for metabolic regulation by the ribotoxic stress response,"Impairment of translation can lead to stalling and collision of ribosomes which constitute an activation platform for several ribosomal stress-surveillance pathways. Among these is the Ribotoxic Stress Response (RSR), where ribosomal sensing by the MAP3K ZAKa leads to activation of p38 and JNK kinases. Despite these insights, the physiological ramifications of ribosomal impairment and downstream RSR signaling remain elusive. Here we show that stalling of ribosomes is sufficient to activate ZAKa. In response to amino acid deprivation and full nutrient starvation, RSR impacts on the ensuing metabolic responses in cells, nematodes and mice. The RSR-regulated responses in these model systems include regulation of AMPK and mTOR signaling, survival under starvation conditions, stress hormone production and regulation of blood sugar control. In addition, ZAK-/- mice present with a lean phenotype. Our work highlights stalled ribosomes as metabolic signals and demonstrates a role for RSR signaling in metabolic regulation.

PRJNA842957,Expression profiling in brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes in mouse models of Cranial Cavernous Malformation disease,"Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCMs) are neurovascular lesions caused by loss-of-function mutations in one of three genes, including KRIT1 (CCM1), CCM2, and PDCD10 (CCM3). Following onset, disease severity ranges from minimal vascular defects to numerous vascular dilations (lesions) distributed throughout the brain. Although the precise pathogenic mechanisms resulting in such a broad range of disease severity are unknown, inter-cellular communication between heterogeneous brain cell types including microvascular endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons are likely important in disease progression. To further understand these cell type relationships in the context of CCM, Riboseq was performed in astroctytes and mRNA expression profiling was performed from whole brain extracts as well as isolated brain microvascular endothelial cells. Overall design: Pdcd10BECKO (Slco1c1-iCreERT2;Pdcd10fl/fl) and Pdcd10fl/fl control mice were crossed with a ribosome tagged mouse line (Aldh1l1-EGFP/Rpl10a).

PRJNA842067,Translation and Natural Selection of long non-canonical RNA micropeptides,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides but lacking canonical coding sequences. Apparently unable to produce peptides, lncRNA function seems to only involve RNA sequence and structure. Here, we exhaustively detect in-vivo translation of small open reading frames (small ORFs) within lncRNAs using Ribosomal profiling during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis. We show that around 30% of lncRNAs contain small ORFs engaged by ribosomes, leading to regulated translation of 100 to 300 micropeptides. We identify lncRNA features that favour translation, such as cistronicity, Kozak sequences, and conservation. For this latter, we develop a bioinformatics pipeline to detect small ORF homologues, and we reveal evidence of natural selection favouring the conservation of micropeptide sequence and function across evolution. Our results expand the repertoire of lncRNA functions, and suggest that lncRNAs give rise to novel coding genes throughout evolution. Since most lncRNAs contain small ORFs with as yet unknown translation potential, we propose to rename them “long non-canonical RNAs”. Overall design: We  performed gene expression profiling analysis by additional sequencing of previously-obtained Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq libraries (Embryo and S2 cells), see Patraquim et a. (2020).

PRJNA841499,Translation initiation of the MgtL leader peptide is essential for the expression of mgtA in Escherichia coli ,"Riboswitches are cis-acting regulating RNA elements mostly found in the 5'-UTR of bacterial mRNAs. The Salmonella enterica mgtA riboswitch controls mgtA expression upon the sensing of intracellular Mg2+ ions. A leader peptide (MgtL) is contained within the mgtA riboswitch and its translation has been previously shown to be affected by Mg2+ concentrations. The current regulatory model suggests that the efficiency of MgtL translation is inversely related to mgtA transcription. Herein we show that the orthologue mgtA riboswitch of Escherichia coli also contains a leader peptide but, unlike S. enterica, that its translation is proportionally related to mgtA expression. Our results also suggest that ribosome stalling at mgtL is crucial for mgtA expression. Together, our results indicate that in E. coli, the expression of the MgtL leader peptide and mgtA are positively coordinated according to the intracellular Mg2+ concentration, a unique mechanism among known riboswitches.

PRJNA838843,Multifarious translational regulation during replicative aging in yeast,"Protein synthesis is strictly regulated during replicative aging in yeast, but global translational regulation during replicative aging is poorly characterized. To conduct ribosomal profiling during replicative aging, we collected a large number of dividing aged cells using a miniature chemostat aging device. Translational efficiency, defined as the number of ribosome footprints normalized to transcript abundance, was compared between young and aged cells for each gene. We identified more than 700 genes with changes greater than twofold during replicative aging. Increased translational efficiency was observed in genes involved in DNA repair and chromosome organization. Decreased translational efficiency was observed in genes encoding ribosome components, transposon Ty1 and Ty2 genes, transcription factor HAC1 genes associated with the unfolded protein response, genes involved in cell wall synthesis and assembly, and ammonium permease genes. Our results provide a global view of translational regulation during replicative aging, in which the pathways involved in various cell functions are translationally regulated and cause diverse phenotypic changes.

PRJNA837585,Pyruvate Kinase M (PKM) binds ribosomes in a poly-ADP ribosylation dependent manner to induce translational stalling,"In light of the numerous studies identifying post-transcriptional regulators on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we ask whether there are factors that regulate compartment specific mRNA translation in human cells. Using a proteomic survey of spatially regulated polysome interacting proteins, we identified the glycolytic enzyme Pyruvate Kinase M (PKM) as a cytosolic (i.e., ER-excluded) polyribosome interactor and investigate how it influences mRNA translation. We discovered that the PKM-polysome interaction is directly regulated by ADP levels–providing a link between carbohydrate metabolism and mRNA translation. By performing enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation-sequencing (eCLIP-seq), we found that PKM crosslinks to mRNA sequences that are immediately downstream of regions that encode for lysine and glutamate enriched tracts. Additionally, PKM binding to ribosomes causes translational stalling near these lysine and glutamate encoding sequences. Lastly, we find that PKM recruitment to polysomes is dependent on poly-ADP ribosylation. Overall, our study uncovers a novel role for PKM in posttranscriptional gene regulation, linking cellular metabolism and mRNA translation, and provides the first reported evidence of nascent chains being co-translationally modified with poly-ADP ribose.

PRJNA833301,Subfunctionalized expression drives evolutionary retention of ribosomal protein paralogs Rps27 and Rps27l in vertebrates,"The formation of paralogs through gene duplication is a core evolutionary process. For paralogs that encode components of protein complexes such as the ribosome, a central question is whether they encode functionally distinct proteins, or whether they exist to maintain appropriate total expression of equivalent proteins. Here, we systematically tested evolutionary models of paralog function using the ribosomal protein paralogs Rps27 (eS27) and Rps27l (eS27L) as a case study. Evolutionary analysis suggests that Rps27 and Rps27l likely arose during whole-genome duplication(s) in a common vertebrate ancestor. We show that Rps27 and Rps27l have inversely correlated mRNA abundance across mouse cell types, with the highest Rps27 in lymphocytes and the highest Rps27l in mammary alveolar cells and hepatocytes. By endogenously tagging the Rps27 and Rps27l proteins, we demonstrate that Rps27- and Rps27l-ribosomes associate preferentially with different transcripts. Furthermore, murine Rps27 and Rps27l loss-of-function alleles are homozygous lethal at different developmental stages. However, strikingly, expressing Rps27 protein from the endogenous Rps27l locus or vice versa completely rescues loss-of-function lethality and yields mice with no detectable deficits. Together, these findings suggest that Rps27 and Rps27l are evolutionarily retained because their subfunctionalized expression patterns render both genes necessary to achieve the requisite total expression of two equivalent proteins across cell types. Our work represents the most in-depth characterization of a mammalian ribosomal protein paralog to date and highlights the importance of considering both protein function and expression when investigating paralogs. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of the total ribosome fraction and FLAG-immunoprecipitated (IP) ribosome fraction from Rps27-FLAG, Rps27l-FLAG, and untagged wild-type (WT) control mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). IP ribosome fractions from Rps27-FLAG and Rps27l-FLAG mESCs represent Rps27- and Rps27l-containing ribosomes, respectively. All samples were collected in triplicate."
PRJNA832792,Circadian ribosome profiling reveals a role for the Period2 upstream opening reading frame in sleep,"Many mammalian proteins have circadian cycles of production and degradation, but de novo transcription is only responsible for a small fraction of this rhythmicity. We used ribosome profiling to quantify RNA translation in liver from circadian-entrained mice transferred to constant darkness conditions over a 24-h period and compared translation levels to absolute protein production for 16 circadian proteins. We observed a delay between translation and peak protein levels for several circadian genes covering a wide range of translation efficiencies. We found extensive binding of ribosomes to upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in circadian mRNAs, including the core clock gene Period2 (Per2). Increased uORFs in 5' UTRs was associated with decreased ribosome binding in downstream ORFs and reduced expression of synthetic reporter constructs in vitro and in single cells. Mutation of the Per2 uORF increased luciferase and fluorescence reporter expression in 3T3 cells without altering phase or period. Genomic Per2 uORF mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 increased PER2 expression in PER2:Luc MEFs and reduced sleep in Per2 uORF mutant mice. These results suggest that post-transcriptional processes shape translation of mRNA transcripts, which can impact physiological rhythms and sleep.

PRJNA831863,LncReader: identification of dual functional long non-coding RNAs using multi-head self-attention mechanism [Ribo-seq],"The dual functional lncRNAs have been intensively studied and identified to be involved in various fundamental cellular processes recently. It is essential to understand in which context when a dual functional lncRNA serves as a non-coding RNA or a template for coding peptide, particularly in some pathological conditions. However, apart from time consuming and cell type specific experiments, there is virtually no in-silico method for predicting the identity of dual functional lncRNAs. Here, we developed a deep-learning model with multi-head self-attention mechanism, LncReader, to identify dual functional lncRNAs based on their sequence, physicochemical and secondary structural features. Our data demonstrated that LncReader showed multiple advantage compared to various classical machine learning methods. Moreover, to obtain independent in-house datasets for robust testing, mass spectrometry proteomics combined with RNA-seq were applied in four leukemia cell lines. Remarkably, LncReader achieved the best performance among all these datasets. Therefore, LncReader provides a sophisticated and practical tool that enables fast dual functional lncRNAs identification. Overall design: Ribosome-seq of four leukemia cell lines (HL60, MOLM13, K562, THP_1), one replicate of each cell line."

PRJNA831100,Disome profiling of rocaglamide A treatment in HEK293FT cells,"For the past decade, extensive studies of translation have produced a vast amount of ribosome profiling data, an insightful resource for mining of critical details about the dynamics of translation regulation under various biological contexts. Previously, Rocaglamide A (RocA), an anti-tumor heterotricyclic natural compound, has been shown to selectively inhibit translation initiation of a large group of mRNA species by clamping eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) onto poly-purine motifs in the 5' un-translational regions (5'UTRs). However, re-analysis of the previous ribosome profiling datasets revealed an unexpected shift of the ribosome occupancy pattern during early translation elongation upon RocA treatment in various types of cells, for a specific group of mRNA transcripts without poly-purine motifs over-presented in their 5'UTRs. Such perturbation of the translation elongation dynamics can be attributed to the blockage of translating ribosomes due to the binding of eIF4A to the poly-purine sequence in coding sequences. This new mode of action of RocA, which is complementary to the canonical function inhibiting translation initiation, selectively interfere with the translation of the genes involved in fundamental processes such as ATP synthase, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex, et al. In summary, re-analyses of previous ribosome profiling data has revealed the complete dual modes of RocA in blocking translation and thus underlying the potent anti-tumor effect Overall design: Comparative distribution of the disome protected fragments under RocA and DMSO treatment based on disome profiling data analyses."

PRJNA824815,Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq of an acute glucose starvation timecourse and 5 day growth course in S. cerevisiae,"Ribosome profiling provides an opportunity to not only assess how the relative abundance of ribosome association with mRNAs changes in different conditions, but to look more closely at where along mRNAs those ribosomes bind. Here, we used ribosome profiling to calculate the ribosome polarity scores and changes in ribosome footprint read density in both aggregate and gene-specific ways. We profiled a time course of acute glucose starvation followed by glucose readdition and a multi-day growth course through the diauxic shift into stationary phase. We found that ribosome polarity became positive in postdiauxic shift conditions relative to log phase. In acute starvation, polarity shifted positive at our earliest time points but did not continue to do so at later time points. This is consistent with a read density analysis which demonstrated increased density on the 3' half of genes after glucose starvation. Additionally, we performed ribosome profiling in samples that had glucose added back following acute starvation and observed a wave of new ribosome movement near the start codon and approximately 2,000 nucleotides downstream on open reading frames after one and five minutes of readdition, respectively. Our ribosome profiling analysis suggested that elongation slows during starvation which leads to a buildup of ribosomes on the 3' halves of mRNAs. Further, it also indicated ribosomes previously built up can resume translation upon glucose readdition. We used reporter assays to corroborate these findings in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate how yeast regulate translation in response to glucose starvation. Overall design: mRNA and ribosome occupancy profiles of S. cerevisiae in actue glucose starvation, glucose readdition, and mutli-day growth conditions"
PRJNA824486,Parsing the role of NSP1 in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"NSP1 is a major shutoff factor of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The functions of NSP1 and its contribution to SARS-CoV-2 propagation is not well understood. We tackled these questions utilizing methods such as RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and SLAMseq. Overall design: To decipher SARS-CoV-2 NSP1's functions, we performed RNA sequencing following overexpression and fractionation of the wt protein and of two mutants. We also performed SLAMseq analysis on cell overexpressed with NSP1wt and with a mutated NSP1, and on cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or with a SARS-CoV-2?nsp1 mutated virus. Additionally, we performed ribosome profiling on cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or with the SARS-CoV-2?nsp1 mutant."
PRJNA823531,METTL18-mediated histidine methylation on RPL3 modulates translation elongation for proteostasis maintenance.,"Protein methylation occurs predominantly on lysine and arginine residues, but histidine also serves as a substrate for the modification. However, a limited number of enzymes responsible for this modification have been reported. Moreover, the biological role of histidine methylation has remained poorly understood. Here, we report that human METTL18 is a histidine methyltransferase for the ribosomal protein RPL3 and that the modification specifically slows ribosome traverse on tyrosine codons, allowing the proper folding of synthesized proteins. By performing an in vitro methylation assay with a methyl donor analog and quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that His245 of RPL3 is methylated at the t-N position by METTL18. Structural comparison of the modified and unmodified ribosomes showed stoichiometric modification and suggested a role in translation tuning. Indeed, genome-wide ribosome profiling revealed suppressed ribosomal translocation at tyrosine codons by RPL3 methylation. Because the slower elongation provides enough time for nascent protein folding, RPL3 methylation protects cells from the cellular aggregation of Tyr-rich proteins. Our results reveal histidine methylation as an example of a “ribosome code” that ensures proteome integrity in cells. Overall design: Ribosome profiling"

PRJNA822806,A parasitic fungus employs mutated eIF4A to survive on rocaglate-synthesizing Aglaia plants,"Plants often generate secondary metabolites with antifungal properties as defense mechanisms against parasites. Although some fungi may potentially overcome the barrier of antimicrobial compounds, only a limited number of examples and molecular mechanisms of resistance have been reported. Here, we found an Aglaia plant-parasitizing fungus that overcomes the toxicity of rocalgates, which are translation inhibitors synthesized by the plant, through an amino acid substitution in a translation initiation factor (eIF). De novo transcriptome assembly of the fungus revealed that eIF4A, a molecular target of rocaglates, replaces a critical amino acid in the rocaglate binding site. Moreover, genome-wide ribosome profiling harnessing a cucumber-infecting fungus, Colletotrichum orbiculare, demonstrated that the translational inhibitory effects of rocaglates were largely attenuated by the mutation found in the Aglaia parasite. The engineered Colletotrichum orbiculare showed a survival advantage on cucumber plants with rocaglates. Our study exemplifies a plant-fungus tug-of-war centered on secondary metabolites produced by host plants. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq of Colletotrichum orbiculare treated with aglafoline"

PRJNA821061,Short-term transcriptomic changes in the mouse neural tube induced by an acute alcohol exposure,"Alcohol exposure during the formation and closure of the neural tube, or neurulation (embryonic day [E] 8-10 in mice; ~4th week of human pregnancy), perturbs development of midline brain structures and significantly disrupts gene expression in the rostroventral neural tube (RVNT). Previously, alcohol exposure during neurulation was found to alter gene pathways related to cell proliferation, p53 signaling, ribosome biogenesis, immune signaling, organogenesis, and cell migration 6 or 24 hours after administration. Our current study expands upon this work by investigating short-term gene expression changes in the RVNT following a single binge-like alcohol exposure during neurulation. Female C57BL/6J mice were administered a single dose of 2.9 g/kg alcohol or vehicle on E9.0 to target mid-neurulation. The RVNTs of stage-matched embryos were collected 2 or 4 hours after exposure and processed for RNA-seq. Functional profiling was performed with g:Profiler, as well as the CiliaCarta and DisGeNet databases. Two hours following E9.0 alcohol exposure, 650 genes in the RVNT were differentially expressed. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that pathways related to cellular metabolism, gene expression, cell cycle, organogenesis, and Hedgehog signaling were down-regulated and pathways related to cellular stress response, p53 signaling, and hypoxia were up-regulated by alcohol. Four hours after alcohol, 225 genes were differentially expressed. Biological processes related to metabolism, RNA binding, ribosome biogenesis, and methylation were down-regulated, while protein localization and binding, autophagy, and intracellular signaling pathways were up-regulated. Two hr after alcohol, the differentially expressed genes were associated with disease terms related to eye and craniofacial development and anoxia. These data provide further information regarding the biological functions targeted by alcohol exposure during neurulation in regions of the neural tube that give rise to alcohol-sensitive midline brain structures. Disruption of these gene pathways contributes to the craniofacial and brain malformations associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Overall design: RNA-seq at 2 or 4 hours after alcohol exposure in E9.0 gastrulation-stage embryos of C57BL6/J mice"
PRJNA819978,Ncs2* mediates in vivo virulence of pathogenic yeast through sulphur modification of cytoplasmic transfer RNA,"Fungal pathogens threaten ecosystems and human health. Understanding the molecular basis of their virulence is key to develop new treatment strategies. Here, we characterize NCS2*, a point mutation identified in a clinical baker's yeast isolate. Ncs2 is essential for 2-thiolation of tRNA and the NCS2* mutation leads to increased thiolation at body temperature. NCS2* yeast exhibits enhanced fitness when grown at elevated temperatures or when exposed to oxidative stress, inhibition of nutrient signalling, and cell-wall stress. Importantly, Ncs2* alters the interaction and stability of the thiolase complex likely mediated by nucleotide binding. The absence of 2-thiolation abrogates the in vivo virulence of pathogenic baker's yeast in infected mice. Finally, hypomodification triggers changes in colony morphology and hyphae formation in the common commensal pathogen Candida albicans resulting in decreased virulence in a human cell culture model. These findings demonstrate that 2-thiolation of tRNA acts as a key mediator of fungal virulence and reveal new mechanistic insights into the function of the highly conserved tRNA-thiolase complex. Overall design: Wild type and 2-thiolation deficient Candida albicans strains were analysed by ribosome profiling at 30 °C, 37 °C and 41 °C."
PRJNA819859,Ribosomal RNA 2’-O-methylation dynamics during development and differentiation impact cell fate decisions.,"Variable rRNA 2'-O-me contributes to ribosome heterogeneity. We show that the rRNA 2'-O-me profile is dynamic in a tissue-specific manner during the directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). 2'-O-me at position 26S:3904 transiently decreases at the neural progenitor (NPC) stage during neurogenesis. Knock-out of SNORD52, the guide of 28S:3904 2'-O-me, results in hESCs shifting to a NPC identity. We report that the lack of 28S:3904 methylation leads to an increased binding to the FMRP protein and translation of WNT pathway members. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of H9 and H9SNORD52 knockout cells. H9 cells have rRNA 28S:Um3904 methylation whereas H9SNORD52 knockout cells do not have 28S:Um3904 methylation."

PRJNA819494,Physiological and transcriptional profiling of surfactin exerted antifungal effect against Candida albicans,"Given the risk of Candida albicans overgrowth in the gut, novel complementary therapies should be developed to reduce fungal dominancy. This study highlights the antifungal characteristics of a Bacillus subtilis-derived secondary metabolite, surfactin with high potential against C. albicans. Surfactin inhibited the growth of C. albicans following a 1-hour exposure, in addition to reduced adhesion and morphogenesis. Specifically, surfactin did not affect the level of reactive oxygen species but increased the level of reduced glutathione. Surprisingly, ethanol production was increased following 2 hours of surfactin exposure. Surfactin treatment caused a significant reduction in intracellular iron, manganese and zinc content compared to control cells, whereas the level of copper was not affected. Alongside these physiological properties, surfactin also enhanced fluconazole efficacy. To gain detailed insights into the surfactin-related effects on C. albicans, genome-wide gene transcription analysis was performed. Surfactin treatment resulted in 1390 differentially expressed genes according to total transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Of these, 773 and 617 genes with at least a 1.5-fold increase or decrease in transcription, respectively, were selected for detailed investigation. Several genes involved in morphogenesis or related to metabolism (e.g., glycolysis, ethanol and fatty acid biosynthesis) were down-regulated. Moreover, surfactin decreased the expression of ERG1, ERG3, ERG9, ERG10 and ERG11 involved in ergosterol synthesis, whereas genes associated with ribosome biogenesis and iron metabolism and drug transport-related genes were up-regulated. Our data demonstrate that surfactin significantly influences the physiology and gene transcription of C. albicans, and could contribute to the development of a novel innovative complementary therapy. Overall design: Examination of untreated control and 128 mg/L surfactin-treated Candida albicans cultures in three replicates."

PRJNA818335,Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus induces specialized ribosomes to efficiently translate viral lytic mRNAs,"Historically, ribosomes have been viewed as unchanged homogeneous macromolecular machines with no intrinsic regulatory capacity for mRNA translation. However, an emerging concept is that heterogeneity of ribosomal composition exists, which can exert a regulatory function or specificity in translational control. This is supported by recent discoveries identifying compositionally distinct 'specialized ribosomes' that actively regulate mRNA translation. Viruses lack their own translational machinery and impose a high translational demand on the host cell during replication. Whilst viruses have evolved a variety of mechanisms to overcome this, we hypothesize that some viruses manipulate the host cell to produce specialized ribosomes to preferentially translate viral transcripts. Quantitative proteomic analysis has identified changes in the stoichiometry and composition of precursor ribosomal complexes during the switch from latent to lytic KSHV replication. Intriguingly, we demonstrate the enhanced association of ribosomal biogenesis factors BUD23 and NOC4L, and a previously uncharacterized KSHV lytic protein, ORF11, with small ribosomal subunit precursor complexes during lytic KSHV infection. Notably, BUD23 depletion resulted in significantly reduced viral gene expression and progression through the lytic cascade, culminating in a dramatic reduction of infectious virion production. Importantly, ribosome profiling demonstrated that BUD23 is essential for the reduced association of ribosomes with KSHV uORFs in late lytic genes, required for the efficient translation of the main open reading frame. Together our results provide new mechanistic insight into KSHV-mediated manipulation of cellular ribosome composition inducing a population of specialized ribosomes to facilitate efficient translation of viral mRNAs. Overall design: TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, a primary effusion lymphoma B cell line latently infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and modified to contain doxycycline inducible myc-RTA. Samples were collected from two TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines where lytic replication of KSHV had been induced by doxycycline for 36 hours and each cell line stably expressed either a scrambled control shRNA or a shRNA targeting BUD23. From each cell line a polyA RNA reference sample was collected and a ribosome footprint sample. Two biological replicates were completed for this experiment. The final manuscript discusses KSHV data."
PRJNA817730,Comparative oxidation proteomics analyses suggest redox regulation of cytosolic translation in rice leaves upon Magnaporthe oryzae infection,"Pathogen attack can increase plant levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which then act as signaling molecules activating plant defense. Elucidating these processes is crucial to understanding the redox signaling pathways in plant defense responses. By an iodo TMT-based quantitative proteomic approach, we mapped 3,362 oxidized cysteine sites in 2,275 proteins in rice leaves. Oxidized proteins were involved in gene expression, peptide biosynthetic processes, stress responses, ROS metabolic processes, and translation pathways. Magnaporthe oryzae infection led to increased oxidation modification levels of 512 cysteine sites in 438 proteins, including many transcriptional regulators and ribosomal proteins. Ribo-seq analysis revealed that the oxidation modification of ribosomal proteins promoted the translational efficiency of many mRNAs involved in defense response pathways, thereby affecting rice immunity. Our results suggest that increased oxidative modification of ribosomal proteins in rice leaves promotes cytosolic translation, revealing a novel function of post-translational modifications. Furthermore, the oxidation-sensitive proteins identified here provided a valuable research resource of research on protein redox regulation and could guide future mechanistic studies."
PRJNA817264,Discovery and functional interrogation of the virus and host RNA interactome of SARS-CoV-2 proteins [Ribo-Seq],"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding the molecular functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is thus imperative to developing effective antiviral treatments. Here, we use enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation to investigate SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions with viral and host RNAs. SARS-CoV-2 proteins, NSP8 and NSP12, are found to specifically bind to untranslated regions of the RNA viral genome, with NSP12 additionally binding to all transcription regulatory sequences. This provides evidence for their central roles in replication and transcription. Moreover, we discovered a potential site of NSP12 mediated genome recombination, which could explain the genetic diversity found in coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 proteins exogenously expressed in human lung epithelial cells bind to 4,281 unique host RNAs. Nine SARS-CoV-2 proteins upregulate target gene expression, including NSP12 which upregulates mitochondrial electron transport and N-linked glycosylation proteins. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of NSP12-targeted proteins in human lung organoid cells demonstrates substantial antiviral effects. Conversely, NSP9 inhibits host gene expression via blocking mRNA export and dampens antiviral inflammation response such as interleukin 1a (IL1a) production. Our extensive viral protein-RNA interactome provides a catalog of potential therapeutic targets and offers insight into the etiology of COVID-19 as a safeguard against future pandemics. Overall design: Total mRNA and mRNA in the polysomal fraction of two biological replicates were sequenced from BEAS-2B cells overexpressing ORF9c and compared to cells transfected with an empty plasmid vector."

PRJNA815336,An adverse tumor-protective effect of IDO1 inhibition,"Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a metabolic enzyme catalyzing the conversion of the essential amino acid tryptophan to kynurenine. It is induced by IFNg and its expression is linked to poor prognosis across various cancer types. T cells are particularly sensitive to IDO1-dependent tryptophan deprivation in the tumor microenvironment, leading to tumor immune resistance. Therefore, IDO1 inhibitors, such as epacadostat, have been developed, aiming to restore T cell antitumor activity. However, a recent phase III trial assessing the clinical benefit of epacadostat with the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab in melanoma failed. This prompted us to study the role of IDO1, and the effect of its inhibition, on tumor cells that are under IFNg treatment and T cell attack. We showed that IDO1-mediated tryptophan depletion contributes to the anti-tumor effect of CD8 T cells. Thus, while epacadostat expectedly replenished tryptophan -the desired effect-, this led to adverse protection of melanoma cells from T cell-derived IFNg. RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling of (patient-derived) melanoma cell lines revealed that IFNg caused general protein translation shut down, which was reversed by IDO1 inhibition. Impaired translation was accompanied by an amino acid deprivation-dependent stress response driving ATF4high and MITFlow transcriptomic signatures, which was also observed in melanoma patient tumors. Downregulation of MITF in tumors and PDX- derived cell lines upon treatment was strongly predictive of response to response, to  checkpoint blockade-treatment and IFNg, respectively. Conversely, MITF restoration in cultured tumor cells caused T cell resistance. These results highlight the critical role of tryptophan in the melanoma response to T cell-derived IFNg, uncovering an unexpected negative consequence of IDO1 inhibition.  Overall design: 16 low-passage (less than 30) Patient-derived cell lines were plated at day 0 and treated with recombinant human IFNg (Preprotech) at 10ng/mL at day 1 and harvested after 24 hours (day2)."
PRJEB45877,"RNASeq of MARC-145 or MA-104 cells infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-1 or PRRSV-2, harvested at 3-12 hpi","Cell lines derived from Chlorocebus sabaeus kidney were infected with an isolate of PRRSV-1 or PRRSV-2 and RNASeq was performed (this entry) in parallel with ribosome profiling (see related accession numbers). These RNASeq datasets provide information on the transcriptome of PRRSV-infected cells and were used to detect novel viral transcripts and perform differential gene expression analysis on host transcripts. For the PRRSV-1 experiments, MA-104 cells were infected with an isolate based on the Porcilis vaccine strain (KJ127878.1 but with several accumulated mutations, see associated publication) and harvested at 8 hpi after pre-treatment with cycloheximide (CHX). For the PRRSV-2 experiments, MARC-145 cells were infected with SD95-21 PRRSV (KC469618.1), and a mutant thereof (KO2). One group of samples was harvested at 9 hpi after pre-treatment with CHX, and another group of samples was harvested at 3, 6, 9 and 12 hpi by flash-freezing without CHX pre-treatment. For all samples, RNA was extracted, ribosomal RNA was removed using Illumina's RiboZero kit, and remaining RNA was gel purified to select fragments 25-34 nt (PRRSV-1-infected samples, CHX-pre-treated PRRSV-2- or mock-infected samples, and non-CHX-pre-treated PRRSV-2- or mock-infected 9 hpi replicate one samples) or ~50 nt long (all other samples). Fragments were cloned into adapters based on the TruSeq small RNA adapters. For all PRRSV-2-infected (or mock-infected) libraries, adapters with an additional seven random nucleotides at the 5'-end of the 3'-adapter and the 3'-end of the 5'-adapter were used. For PRRSV-1 replicate one, no random nucleotides were present on the adapters, and for PRRSV-1 replicate two, 14 random nucleotides were present at the 5'-end of the 3'-adapter. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform as a single-end run. For one NextSeq run, some potyvirus amplicons, indexed using TruSeq small RNA indices 1-48, was spiked in to the pool directly before sequencing, therefore some libraries (noCHX_RNA_9hpi_KO2_1, noCHX_RNA_9hpi_KO2_2, noCHX_RNA_9hpi_mock_1, noCHX_RNA_9hpi_mock_2, noCHX_RNA_9hpi_WT_1, noCHX_RNA_9hpi_WT_2) have a small proportion of potyvirus reads, but this does not represent co-infection in the biological sample and does not affect the conclusions of the study. Note that sample nomeclature (including replicate numbers) is consistent between this and the two related accessions, and RiboSeq libraries are matched with RNASeq libraries, which were prepared from the same lysate."

These datasets were used to analyse the viral and host translatome, frameshifting on the viral genome, and putative frameshift-related ribosome pausing events. For the PRRSV-1 experiments, MA-104 cells were infected with an isolate based on the Porcilis vaccine strain (KJ127878.1 but with several accumulated mutations, see associated publication) and harvested at 8 hpi after pre-treatment with cycloheximide (CHX). For the PRRSV-2 experiments, MARC-145 cells were infected with SD95-21 PRRSV (KC469618.1), and a mutant thereof (KO2). One group of samples was harvested at 9 hpi after pre-treatment with CHX, and another group of samples was harvested at 3, 6, 9 and 12 hpi by flash-freezing without CHX pre-treatment. For all samples, RNase I treatment was carried out, following which ribosomes and enclosed RNA were isolated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. RNA was extracted, ribosomal RNA was removed using Illumina's RiboZero kit, and remaining RNA was gel purified to select fragments 25-34 nt (PRRSV-1-infected samples, CHX-pre-treated PRRSV-2- or mock-infected samples, and non-CHX-pre-treated PRRSV-2- or mock-infected 9 hpi replicate one samples) or 19-34 nt long (all other samples).

Given the outsized importance of small proteins and peptides in metabolism—insulin, leptin, amylin, glucagon, and glucagon-like peptide-1  (GLP-1)—microproteins are a potentially rich source of uncharacterized metabolic regulators. Here, we annotate smORFs in primary differentiated brown, white, and beige mouse adipose cells. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) detected a total of 3,877 unannotated smORFs. Analysis of RNA-Seq datasets revealed diet-regulated smORF expression in adipose tissues, and validated the adipose translation of the feeding-neuron marker gene Gm8773. Gm8773 encodes the mouse homolog of FAM237B, a neurosecretory protein that stimulates food intake and promotes weight gain in chickens. Testing of recombinant mFAM237B produced similar orexigenic activity in mice further supporting a role for FAM237B a metabolic regulator and part of the brain-adipose axis. Furthermore, we showed that data independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) proteomics can provide a sensitive, flexible, and quantitative platform for identifying microproteins by mass spectrometry. Using this system led to the detection of 58 microproteins from cell culture and an additional 25 from mouse serum. The proteomics data established the anti-inflammatory microprotein AW112010 as a circulating factor, and found that serum levels of a microprotein translated from a FRS2 uORF is elevated in older obese mice.

PRJNA811788,Frequent 4EBP1 amplification induces synthetic dependence on FGFR signaling in cancer,"The eIF4E translation initiation factor has oncogenic properties and concordantly, the inhibitory eIF4E-binding protein (4EBP1) is considered a tumor suppressor. The exact molecular effects of 4EBP1 activation in cancer are still unknown. Surprisingly, 4EBP1 is a target of genomic copy number gains (Chr. 8p11) in breast and lung cancer. We notice that 4EBP1 gains are genetically linked to gains in neighboring genes including WHSC1L1 and FGFR1. Our results show that FGFR1 gains act to attenuate the function of 4EBP1 via PI3K mediated phosphorylation at Thr37/46, Ser65, and Thr70 sites. This implies that not 4EBP1 but instead FGFR1 is the genetic target of Chr. 8p11 gains in breast and lung cancer. Accordingly, these tumors show increased sensitivity to FGFR1 and PI3K inhibition and this is a therapeutic vulnerability through restoring the tumor-suppressive function of 4EBP1. Ribosome profiling reveals genes involved in insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, and inositol pathway to be the relevant translational targets of 4EBP1. These mRNAs are among the top 200 translation targets and are highly enriched for structure and sequence motifs in their 5'UTR that depends on the 4EBP1-EIF4E activity. In summary, we identify the translational targets of 4EBP1-EIF4E that facilitate the tumor suppressor function of 4EBP1 in cancer.   Overall design: We performed ribosome footprinting and RNA sequencing on six samples of 293T 4A cells including three untreated samples (DMSO) and three samples that were collected 2 hrs after treatment with Doxycycline (2mg/ml). DMSO treated samples are indicated as CT and Dox treated samples are indicate as Dox."

PRJNA810853,Stress-induced transcriptional readthrough into neighboring genes is linked to intron retention,"Exposure to certain stresses leads to readthrough transcription downstream of gene ends. Here we found that this phenomenon impacts the expression of genes located downstream to readthrough genes, whereby readthrough transcription proceeds into downstream genes, termed read-in genes. Using polyA-selected RNA-seq data from mouse fibroblasts, we identified widespread read-in in heat shock, oxidative and osmotic stress conditions. Read-in genes share distinctive genomic characteristics; they are extremely short, mainly due to less, shorter, introns, and they are highly GC rich. Furthermore, using ribosome footprint profiling we found that the translation of genes with high degrees of read-in is significantly reduced. Strikingly, read-in genes show extremely high levels of intron retention during stress, mostly in their first intron. While read-in genes share features that are generally associated with increased likelihood of intron retention, such as short introns and high GC content, intron retention in read-in genes during stress exceeds greatly beyond what is expected given their genomic properties. Finally, we found that first introns in read-in genes have weaker 5' and 3' splice sites. Our data portray a relationship between read-in and intron retention, suggesting it may have co-evolved to facilitate reduced translation of read-in genes during stress. Overall design: Induction of various types of stress in NIH3T3 cells, followed by transcriptome and translatome analysis."
PRJNA809587,Translatome and transcriptome co-profiling reveals a role of TPRXs in human zygotic genome activation,"Translational regulation plays a critical role during oocyte-to-embryo transition including zygotic genome activation. However, the translatome during OET and molecular mechanisms underlying human ZGA remain largely uncharted. Here, we integrated ultra-low-input Ribo-seq with RNA-seq (R2-lite) to jointly profile the translatome and transcriptome from the same samples across 8 stages in human oocytes and early embryos. These data not only unveil conservation and divergence of the translation landscapes between human and mouse OET, but also identify critical regulators of human ZGA. Overall design: Ultra-low-input Ribo-seq(Ribo-lite) with RNA-seq (R2-lite) was performed on human oocytes and early embryos. RNA-seq was performed on human embryos with knockdown of transcription factors or under drug treatment.  RNA-seq and Stacc-seq were performed on hESC overexpressing transcription factors."
PRJNA809314,Intron-mediated induction of phenotypic heterogeneity,"Introns are universally present in the nuclear genomes of eukaryotes. The budding yeast, an otherwise intron-poor species, preserves two sets of ribosomal protein (RP) genes differing primarily in their introns. Despite recent findings on the role of RP introns under stress and starvation, understanding the contribution of introns to ribosome regulation remains challenging. Here, combining isogrowth profiling with single-cell protein measurements, we found that introns can mediate inducible phenotypic heterogeneity conferring a clear fitness advantage. Osmotic stress leads to bimodal expression of the small ribosomal subunit protein Rps22B, mediated by an intron in the 5' untranslated region of its transcript. The two resulting yeast subpopulations differ in their ability to cope with starvation. Low Rps22B protein levels resulted in prolonged survival under sustained starvation, while high Rps22B levels enabled cells to grow faster after transient starvation. Further, yeast growing at high sugar concentrations – similar to those in ripe grapes – exhibit bimodal Rps22B expression when approaching stationary phase. Differential intron-mediated regulation of RP genes thus provides a way to diversify the population when starvation looms in natural environments. Our findings reveal a new role for introns in inducing phenotypic heterogeneity in changing environments and suggest that duplicated RP genes in yeast contribute to resolving the evolutionary conflict between precise expression control and environmental responsiveness. Overall design: RNA samples from treatments with single stressors were obtained from cultures with automated re-inoculation every 8 hours, with a total incubation time of 24 hours, to keep cultures in exponential phase and assure the drug effects have taken place. Strains were grown in YPD with a drug, either in a concentration gradient to select samples closest to 50% of growth inhibition (LiCl, Fenpropimorph, and Myriocin), or in a single concentration (0.4 M NaCl and glucose 20%). Fenpropimorph (Sigma Aldrich cat. No. 36772) was tested in a 0.5-1.5 µM gradient, sequenced samples were treated with 0.85 µM Fenpropimorph. Myriocin (Sigma Aldrich cat. No. 476300) gradient encompassed 0.25-0.75 µg/ml; 0.32 µg/ml Myriocin samples were sequenced. For each sample of extracted RNA, both ribodepleted total RNA and mRNA Seq libraries were prepared at the Cologne Center for Genomics (CCG) and sequenced using 2×100bp paired-end reads."
PRJNA808741,"Development of nanoRibo-seq enables study of regulated translation by cortical neuron subtypes, showing uORF translation in synaptic-axonal genes","Investigation of translation in rare cell types or subcellular contexts is challenging due to large input requirements for standard approaches. Here, we present “nanoRibo-seq” an optimized approach using 102- to 103-fold less input material than bulk approaches. nanoRibo-seq exhibits rigorous quality control features consistent with quantification of ribosome protected fragments with as few as 1,000 cells. We compare translatomes of two closely related cortical neuron subtypes, callosal projection neurons (CPN) and subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN), during their early postnatal development. We find that, while translational efficiency is highly correlated between CPN and SCPN, several dozen mRNAs are differentially translated. We further examine upstream open reading frame (uORF) translation and identify that mRNAs involved in synapse organization and axon development are highly enriched for uORF translation in both subtypes. nanoRibo-seq enables investigation of translational regulation of rare cell types in vivo and offers a flexible approach for globally quantifying translation from limited input material.

PRJNA806948,5-Fluorouridine restores functional full-length p53 in TP53 nonsense mutant human tumor cells (RNA-Seq),"The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is mutated in approximately half of all human tumors. Of those, around 10% are nonsense mutations that produce truncated and inactive p53 protein. Induction of translational readthrough is a promising approach for rescuing full-length p53 and thereby eliminate tumor cells with nonsense mutant TP53. To find novel nonsense mutant TP53 readthrough-inducing compounds with a tolerable toxicity profile, we performed an in silico screening of data at the National Cancer Institute database and identified 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). We show here that 5-FU induces full-length p53 in human tumor cells carrying R213X nonsense mutant TP53 and that this activity is mediated by its metabolite 5-Fluorouridine (FUr). Ribo-seq analysis validated induction of translational readthrough by FUr. We also show that FUr is incorporated into RNA where it potentially allows base pairing of Arg tRNA at the R213X UGA premature termination codon. Full-length p53 rescued by FUr is transcriptionally active and triggers p53-dependent cell death. Moreover, treatment with 5-FU or FUr restores full-length p53 expression in TP53 R213X mutant human tumor xenografts in vivo. Our results suggest that induction of readthrough by 5-FU/FUr could contribute to therapeutic efficacy in patients with TP53 nonsense mutant tumors. Overall design: mRNA-seq analysis of readthrough in three conditions (Untreated, FUr, G418) in empty vector and R213X vector. Four replicates per group."

PRJNA805180,High-resolution Ribosome Profiling Reveals Translational Selectivity in Bovine Preimplantation Embryo Development,"High resolution polysome fractionation and low-input ribosome profiling of bovine oocytes and preimplantation embryos has enabled us to define the translational landscape of early embryo development at an unprecedented level. We systematically and comparatively analyzed the transcriptome, polysome- and nonpolysome-bound RNA profiles of bovine oocytes and early embryos at 2-, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst stage, and defined four modes of translational selectivity in bovine preimplantation embryo development: i. selective translation of non-abundant mRNAs, ii. active translating highly expressed mRNAs, iii. Translationally suppressed abundant mRNAs, and iv. Monosomaly occupied mRNAs. A strong selection towards genes involved in mitochondrial function and metabolic pathways was found throughout bovine preimplantation development. We found translatome largely follows transcriptome at oocytes, followed by a marked translational control at 8-cell embryos, which is gradually synchronized at the morula and blastocyst stage. We identified important novel cellular/embryonic functional regulators that being utilized and prioritized for translation at each developmental stage, that accompanies little-known bovine embryonic developmental programming. Together, these data reveal a unique spatiotemporal translational regulation that accompanies bovine preimplantation development. Overall design: First, 10 ribosome fractionations were collected from each of 200 bovine oocytes (GV and MII stage oocyte) or preimplantation embryos at 2-, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages, followed by RNA-sequencing analysis. This experiment was performed in biological duplicates. In addition, the oocytes or embryos collected from the same batch in each developmental stage were used to profile their transcriptomes by mRNA-seq. This experiment was performed in biological triplicates."
PRJNA803443,The translational landscape of direct cardiac reprogramming reveals a role of Ybx1 in repressing cardiac fate acquisition [Ribo-seq and RNA-seq],"Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) holds great promise for heart regeneration. Although great progress has been made in understanding the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of iCM reprogramming, its translational regulation remains largely unexplored. Here we characterized the translational landscape of iCM reprogramming using integrative ribosome and transcriptomic profiling, and showed extensive translatome re-patterning during fibroblast conversion into iCM. Loss of function screening for translational regulators uncovered Ybx1 as a critical barrier to iCM induction. Knockdown of Ybx1 dramatically improved the efficiency and quality of iCM reprogramming. Mechanistically, Ybx1 directly bound the transcripts of Srf and Baf60c, both of which mediated, at least partially, the repressive effect of Ybx1 on iCM generation.and Depletion of Ybx1 de-repressed the translation of its targets including SRF and Baf60c. Interestingly, upon removing Ybx1, Tbx5 alone could reprogram fibroblasts into iCMs that exhibit classic iCM molecular features and reprogramming trajectories revealed by our single cell dual-omics.

PRJNA802892,Influenza virus repurposes the antiviral protein IFIT2 to promote translation of viral mRNAs,"Cells infected by influenza virus mount a large-scale antiviral response and most cells ultimately initiate cell-death pathways in an attempt to suppress viral replication. We performed a CRISPR/Cas9-knockout selection designed to identify host factors required for replication following viral entry. We identified a large class of presumptive antiviral factors that unexpectedly act as important pro-viral enhancers during influenza virus infection. One of these, IFIT2, is an interferon-stimulated gene with well-established antiviral activity but limited mechanistic understanding. As opposed to suppressing infection, we show here that IFIT2 is instead repurposed by influenza virus to promote viral gene expression. CLIP-seq demonstrated that IFIT2 binds directly to viral and cellular mRNAs in AU-rich regions, with bound cellular transcripts enriched in interferon-stimulated mRNAs. Polysome and ribosome profiling revealed that IFIT2 prevents ribosome pausing on bound mRNAs. Together, the data link IFIT2 binding to enhanced translational efficiency for viral and cellular mRNAs and ultimately viral replication. Our findings establish a model for the normal function of IFIT2 as a protein that increases translation of cellular mRNAs to support antiviral responses and explain how influenza virus uses this same activity to redirect a classically antiviral protein into a pro-viral effector.

PRJEB50305,Co-translational assembly counteracts promiscuous interactions - addendum,"During the co-translational assembly of protein complexes, a fully synthesized subunit engages with the nascent chain of a newly synthesized interaction partner. Such events are thought to contribute to productive assembly, but their exact physiological relevance remains underexplored. Here, we examined structural motifs contained in nucleoporins for their potential to facilitate co-translational assembly. We experimentally tested candidate structural motifs and identified several previously unknown co-translational interactions. We demonstrate by selective ribosome profiling that domain invasion motifs of beta-propellers, coiled-coils, and short linear motifs act as co-translational assembly domains. Such motifs are often contained in proteins that are members of multiple complexes (moonlighters) and engage with closely related paralogs. Surprisingly, moonlighters and paralogs assembled co-translationally in only one but not all of the relevant assembly pathways. Our results highlight the regulatory complexity of assembly pathways."
PRJNA801861,RNA m1A methylation regulates glycolysis of cancer cells through modulating ATP5D [Ribo and RNA-seq],"Studies on biological functions of RNA modifications such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA have sprung up in recent years, while the roles of N1-methyladenosine (m1A) in cancer progression remain largely unknown. We find m1A demethylase ALKBH3 can regulate the glycolysis of cancer cells via a demethylation activity dependent manner. Specifically, sequencing and functional studies confirm that ATP5D, one of the most important subunit of ATP synthase, is involved in m1A demethylase ALKBH3-regulated glycolysis of cancer cells. The m1A modified A71 at the Exon 1 of ATP5D negatively regulates its translation elongation via increasing the binding with YTHDF1/eRF1 complex, which facilitates the release of mRNA from ribosome complex. m1A also regulates mRNA stability of E2F1, which directly binds with ATP5D promoter to initiate its transcription. Targeted specific demethylation of ATP5D m1A by dm1ACRISPR system can significantly increase the expression of ATP5D and glycolysis of cancer cells. In vivo data confirm the roles of m1A/ATP5D in tumor growth and cancer progression.

PRJNA801467,A Single-copy Knock In Translating Ribosome ImmunoPrecipitation (SKI TRIP) tool kit for tissue specific profiling of actively translated mRNAs in C. elegans.,"Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) methods have emerged as a powerful approach to profile actively translated transcripts in specific cell and tissue types.  Epitope tagged ribosomal subunits are expressed in defined cell populations and used to pull down ribosomes and their associated mRNAs, providing a snapshot of cell type-specific translation occurring in that space and time. Current TRAP toolkits available to the C. elegans community have been built using multi-copy arrays, randomly integrated in the genome.  Here we introduce a Single-copy Knock In Translating Ribosome ImmunoPrecipitation (SKI TRIP) tool kit, a collection of C. elegans strains engineered by CRISPR in which tissue specific expression of FLAG tagged ribosomal subunit protein RPL-22 is driven by cassettes present in single copy from defined sites in the genome. In depth characterization of the SKI TRIP strains and methodology shows that 3xFLAG tagged RPL-22 expressed from its endogenous locus or within defined cell types incorporates into actively translating ribosomes and can be used to efficiently and cleanly pull-down cell type specific transcripts without impacting overall mRNA translation or fitness of the animal. We propose SKI TRIP use for the study of processes that are acutely sensitive to changes in translation, such as aging. Overall design: RNAseq from C. elegans after Polysome Profiling (total RNA and polysome profiling RNA in triplicates per strain) from WT (polysome profiling RNA of all polysomes) and strains MSD470=ubiquitous (1x polysome profiling RNA of all polysomes (PP); 1x polysome profiling RNA of 60S, 80S and polysomal ribosomes (PP2)) RNAseq from C. elegans after SKI TRIP (IP) experiments (total RNA and IPed RNA in triplicates per strain) from strains MSD470=UBI, WBM1364=soma, WBM1471=neuroB, MSD473=neuroA, WBM1339=muscle, WBM1471=intestine"

PRJNA800783,Systemic Delivery of an AAV9 Exon Skipping Vector Significantly Improves or Prevents Features of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in the Dup2 Mouse Model,"Purpose: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is typically caused by mutations that disrupt the DMD reading frame, but nonsense mutations in the 5' part of the gene lead to the utilization of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in exon 5, resulting in expression of a highly functional N-truncated dystrophin. We have developed an AAV9 vector expressing U7 small nuclear RNAs targeting DMD exon 2 and tested it in a mouse model containing a duplication of exon 2, in which skipping of both exon 2 copies results in IRES-induced expression, and skipping of only one exon 2 leads to wild-type dystrophin expression. Methods: One-time intravascular injection of an AAV9 vector expressing U7 small nuclear RNAs targeting Dmd exon 2 at either P0-P1 or at 2 months of age results in efficient exon skipping and dystrophin expression, and significant protection from functional and pathologic deficits. Results: In mice treated neonatally, dystrophin immunofluorescence reached 49-85% of normal signal intensity and 76-99% dystrophin-positive fibers, with near-complete correction of dystrophic pathology, and these beneficial effects showed no significant signs of declining for at least 6 months. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and Ribosome Profiling (RPF-Seq) indicated that treatment restored a 'non-dystrophic' gene expression profile by reversing the direction and magnitude of differentially expressed genes previously identified in dystrophic skeletal muscle from DMD patients. The dystrophin transcript showed clearly increased RPF reads in the treated sample, indicating that the treatment specifically increased dystrophin translation. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the robustness, durability, and safety of exon 2 skipping following delivery of scAAV9.U7snRNA.ACCA, supporting its clinical use.      Overall design: Skeletal muscle mRNA and ribosome footprinting profiles from Dmd Dup2 mice treated with an AAV9 exon skipping vector"
PRJNA800535,FACS-seq profiling of endogenous promoters of E.coli and a combination of 300 promoters and 13 RBSs,"Research into phenotypic heterogeneity - the phenotypic differences found among a population of cells with the same genetic background and extracellular environmental conditions - has been greatly restricted by current low-throughput characterization approaches. To overcome this, we here propose a data processing pipeline for fluorescence-activated cell sorting and high-throughput DNA sequencing (FACS-seq) that profiles the gene expression distribution of thousands of variants simultaneously. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the algorithm's ability to precisely characterize the expression properties of independent datasets. To analyze noise production, we used our method to investigate the expression characteristics of (1) 3,804 Escherichia coli MG1655 endogenous promoters and (2) a combination of 300 promoters and 13 ribosome binding sites (RBSs) in E. coli."
PRJNA799348,"The Interplay Between Translational Efficiency, Poly(A) Tails, MicroRNAs, and Neuronal Activation","Neurons provide a rich setting for studying post-transcriptional control. Here, we investigate the landscape of translational control in neurons and search for mRNA features that explain differences in translational efficiency (TE), considering the interplay between TE, mRNA poly(A)-tail lengths, microRNAs, and neuronal activation. In neurons and brain tissues, TE correlates with tail length, and a few dozen mRNAs appear to undergo cytoplasmic polyadenylation upon light or chemical stimulation. However, the correlation between TE and tail length is modest, explaining <5% of TE variance, and even this modest relationship diminishes when accounting for other mRNA features. Thus, tail length appears to affect TE only minimally. Accordingly, miRNAs, which accelerate deadenylation of their mRNA targets, primarily influence target mRNA levels, with no detectable effect on either steady-state tail lengths or TE. Larger correlates with TE include codon composition and predicted mRNA folding energy. When combined in a model, the identified correlates explain 38–45% of TE variance. These results provide a framework for considering the relative impact of factors that contribute to translational control in neurons. They indicate that when examined in bulk, translational control in neurons largely resembles that of other types of post-embryonic cells. Thus, detection of more specialized control might require analyses that can distinguish translation occurring in neuronal processes from that occurring in cell bodies. Overall design: The experiments consist of 12 matched samples of ribosome profiling libraries (small RNA-seq and RPF reads, 24 files in total) from primary neuronal cortical culture or mouse tissues. These samples have matched PAL-seq V2 or TAIL-seq data. In addition, there are eight samples (light stimulated mouse visual cortex samples) that have PAL-seq V2 data but no matched ribosome profiling data."

PRJNA798426,An RNAi Screen of RNA Helicases Identifies eIF4A3 as a Regulator of Embryonic Stem Cell Identity [Ribo-seq],"RNA helicases are involved in multiple steps of RNA metabolism to direct their roles in gene expression, yet their functions in pluripotency control remain largely unexplored. Starting from an RNAi screen of RNA helicases, we identified that eIF4A3, a DEAD-box (Ddx) helicase component of the exon junction complex (EJC), is essential for the maintenance of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Mechanistically, we show that eIF4A3 post-transcriptionally controls the pluripotency-related cell cycle regulators and that its depletion causes cellular differentiation via cell cycle dysregulation.  Specifically, eIF4A3 is required for the efficient nuclear export of Ccnb1 mRNA, which encodes Cyclin B1, a key component of the pluripotency-promoting pathway during cell cycle progression of ESCs. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of eIF4A3 and its associated EJC in the post-transcriptional cell cycle control in maintaining stem cell pluripotency. Overall design: eIF4A3 transcriptome profiling was investigated via RNA-seq analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells."
PRJNA795513,"Context-specific translation arrest by evernimicin, an inhibitor of tRNA accommodation","Antibiotics of the orthosomycin class bind at a distinct site on the large subunit of the bacterial ribosome not used by any other known protein synthesis inhibitor. Structural and biochemical in vitro studies suggested that orthosomycins should block accommodation of aminoacyl-tRNAs in the ribosomal A-site arresting the ribosome at the start codons of the genes. However, the mode of action of orthosomycins in the living cell remains unknown. Here, to get a general and unbiased view of the mode of action of orthosomycin antibiotics, we carried out genome-wide ribosome profiling analysis in Escherichia coli cells exposed to evernimicin, one of the most active antibiotics of this class. Our in vivo data, supported by the analysis of evernimicin action upon in vitro translation of a variety of mRNAs, argue that orthosomycins preferentially inhibit translation elongation and act in a context specific manner. We show that evernimicin predominantly arrests translation when the ribosome needs to accommodate Pro-tRNA or Leu-tRNA in the A site while polymerizing specific amino acid sequences. We further show that the discovered context specificity of orthosomycins is exploited for the programmed translation arrest that apparently regulates resistance to these antibiotics. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of E. coli imp4213 cell cultures treated with evernimicin were compared to untreated cultures to study the mechanism of translation inhibition"

PRJNA794846,Identifying DAP5 mRNA translation and direct-binding targets in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using Ribo-seq and CLIP-seq.,"The eIF4G1 DAP5 homolog is involved in several non-canonical translation initiation mechanisms. We applied ribosome profiling and found that DAP5 translationally activated mRNAs are enriched with translated uORFs. We also performed a genome-wide UV-cross linking immunoprecipitation screen (CLIP-seq) for identifying mRNAs that directly interact with DAP5 in hESCs. We found 959 bound mRNAs common to both Abs (out of 1073 and 2152 enriched mRNAs identified by CS and MBL antibodies, respectively). Overall design: To asses DAP5 translation profile we performed ribosome profiling on DAP5-KD and NT control hESCs. The libraries were prepared from cells treated with the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). In parallel, we used a tailored RNA-seq protocol to quantify RNA levels. For the CLIP-seq profiling H9 cells were UV cross-linked, lysed and treated with DNase. DAP5-RNA complexes were pulled down using 2 specific antibodies (Cell Signaling, 5169 or MBL, RN003P). The DAP5 bound mRNAs as well as the total RNA were used for libraries preparation."
PRJEB46361,Co-translational assembly counteracts promiscuous interactions,"During the co-translational assembly of protein complexes, a fully synthesized subunit engages with the nascent chain of a newly synthesized interaction partner. Such events are thought to contribute to productive assembly, but their exact physiological relevance remains underexplored. Here, we examined structural motifs contained in nucleoporins for their potential to facilitate co-translational assembly. We experimentally tested candidate structural motifs and identified several previously unknown co-translational interactions. We demonstrate by selective ribosome profiling that domain invasion motifs of beta-propellers, coiled-coils, and short linear motifs act as co-translational assembly domains. Such motifs are often contained in proteins that are members of multiple complexes (moonlighters) and engage with closely related paralogs. Surprisingly, moonlighters and paralogs assembled co-translationally in only one but not all of the relevant assembly pathways. Our results highlight the regulatory complexity of assembly pathways."
PRJNA794163,Recognition of internal mRNA N7-methylguanosine by QKI shuttles transcripts into stress granules and regulates translation,"N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification, routinely occurring at the 5' cap of mRNA or within tRNA and rRNA, also exists internally in mRNA. Although essential for mRNA translation as well as stress response, the “reader” protein for mRNA internal m7G modification is still unrevealed. Here, we reported that Quaking protein (QKI), especially QKI7, can selectively recognize the internal mRNA m7G decoration in the cytosol of various cell types. We identified over 1000 confident m7G-modified and QKI binding RNA targets with a conserved motif, “GANGAN (N=A/U/G)”. More strikingly, internal m7G reader QKI7 directly interacts with the SG core protein G3BP1 and can shuttle a subset of m7G-modified transcripts into SG mRNA pool under oxidative stress condition. Additionally, by sequestering mRNA within SGs, QKI7 modulates the translation efficiency of selected transcripts. Moreover, in line with the observation that doxorubicin triggers the assembly of SGs, QKI7 mediates the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy drug treatment. Overall design: To identify the directly bound transcripts of QKI (QKI5, QKI6, and QKI7), RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) was conducted in HepG2 cells stable expressing QKI proteins. Briefly, HepG2 cells were infected with lentivirus, pmiRNA1-3 x Flag-QKI. Only the GFP-positive cells were used for study and expanded in DMEM medium. RIP assay was performed with Flag antibody (F3165, Sigma)."

Using purification and in vivo interactome analyses, we show that lncRAP2 forms complexes with proteins that stabilize mRNAs and modulate translation, among them Igf2bp2. Surveying transcriptome-wide Igf2bp2 client mRNAs in white adipocytes reveals selective binding to mRNAs encoding adipogenic regulators and energy expenditure effectors, including Adiponectin. These same target proteins are downregulated when either Igf2bp2 or lncRAP2 is downregulated, hindering adipocyte lipolysis.

Phenome-wide association studies reveal specific associations of genetic variants within both lncRAP2 and Igf2bp2 with body mass and type 2 diabetes, and both lncRAP2 and Igf2bp2 are suppressed in adipose depots of obese and diabetic individuals. Thus, the lncRAP2-Igf2bp2 complex potentiates adipose development and energy expenditure and is associated with susceptibility to obesity-linked diabetes. Overall design: Analysis of lncRAP2-interacting RNAs in adipocytes differentiated in culture using two independent pools of lncRAP2-targeting probes, sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq instrument."

The goal of this experiment was to determine the nucleus accumbens transcriptional response specific to separation from an opposite-sex partner. RNA sequencing was done on polyA enriched transcripts using Illumina single-end sequencing. Samples from 3 groups were from a Ribo-seq protocol using a virally delievered, vole optimized Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification construct (Heiman et al., 2008). These samples contain files for both the input fraction and the pulldown fraction (denoted with a _P suffix). Overall design: This experiment contains 8 groups with 5-9 biological samples per group. Samples were hand dissected adult male prairie vole nucleus accumbens brain tisame-sexue according to Heiman et al., 2014. Half of the groups were males in opposite-sex pairs (experimental groups) while the other half were males in same-sex pairs (naive, control groups). Within each pairing type, animals were cohoused for 2 weeks then they were either separated or remained paired for either 48 hours or 4 weeks prior to tissue collection to assess the transcriptional trajectory of partner loss. RNA integrity and library quality was assessed by TapeStation and only samples with a RIN above 7.3 were prepared into libraries. Library preparation was via the KAPA mRNA HyperPrep kit with polyA enrichment for 1X75 RNA sequencing using Illumina NextSeq V2 for a total read depth of ~20M reads/sample.

Then, we performed ribosome profiling using E14 dorsal brains from control and mutant mice. Next, we performed H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) using isolated NSCs from Hes1-d2-EGFP reporter and cells from dorsal brains of E14 Fbl control and mutant mice. Finally, we treated cells from dorsal brains with inhibitors of methyltransferase and demethylase of H3K27me3 and tested how H3K27me3 changes affects fate of neural stem cells by RNA-seq."
PRJNA789568,Synergistic regulation of transcription and translation in Escherichia coli revealed by co-directional increases in mRNA concentration and translation efficiency,"Translational regulation was investigated at the genome scale in Escherichia coli cells. Using the polysome profiling method, the ribosome occupancy (RO) and ribosome density (RD) of different mRNA copies were determined for several hundred mRNAs during the exponential and stationary phases, providing the most complete characterisation of such regulation in E. coli. Although for most genes, nearly all mRNAs (>90%) were undergoing translation, they were loaded with far fewer than the theoretical maximum number of ribosomes, suggesting translation limitation at the initiation step. Multiple linear regression was used to identify key intrinsic factors involved in the genome-wide regulation of RO and RD (i.e., open reading frame GC%, protein function and localisation). Unexpectedly, mRNA concentration, a factor that depends on cell physiology, was predicted to positively regulate RO and RD during the exponential and stationary phases. Using a set of selected genes controlled by an inducible promoter, we confirmed that increasing the mRNA concentration upon transcription induction led to increases in both RO and ribosome load. The fact that this relationship between mRNA concentration and translation parameters was also effective when E. coli cells naturally adapted to carbon source changes demonstrates its physiological relevance. This work demonstrates that translation regulation is positively controlled by transcript availability. This new mechanism contributes to the co-directional regulation of transcription and translation with synergistic effects on gene expression, and provides a systemic understanding of E. coli cell function. Overall design: We reported RNA-seq data for translatome experiments performed in E. coli MG1655 in two growth phases (exponential phase and stationary phase). In each phase, translatome experiments consisting of 7 RNA-seq for each polysomal fraction from A to G were carried out in triplicates."

PRJNA789173,INRI-seq enables global cell-free analysis of translation initiation and off-target effects of antisense inhibitors,"Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) is a powerful method for the transcriptome-wide assessment of protein synthesis rates and the study of translational control mechanisms. Yet, Ribo-seq also has limitations. These include difficulties with detection of low abundance transcripts and analysis of translation-modulating molecules such as antibiotics, which are often toxic or challenging to deliver into living cells. Here, we have developed in vitro Ribo-seq (INRI-seq), a cell-free method to analyze the translational landscape of a fully customizable synthetic transcriptome. Using Escherichia coli as an example, we show how INRI-seq can be used to analyze the translation initiation sites of a transcriptome of interest. We also study the global impact of direct translation inhibition by antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) to analyze PNA off-target effects. Overall, INRI-seq presents a scalable, sensitive method to study translation initiation in a transcriptome-wide manner without the potentially confounding effects of extracting ribosomes from living cells.

PRJNA787625,eIF3 and its mRNA-entry-channel arm contribute to the recruitment of mRNAs with long 5'-untranslated regions,"Translation initiation in eukaryotes is multi-step pathway and the most regulated phase of translation. Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 is the largest and most complex of the translation initiation factors, and it contributes to events throughout the initiation pathway. In particular, eIF3 appears to play critical roles in mRNA recruitment. More recently, eIF3 has been implicated in driving the selective translation of specific classes of mRNAs. However, unraveling the mechanism of these diverse contributions — and disentangling the roles of the individual subunits of the eIF3 complex — remains challenging. We employed ribosome profiling of budding yeast cells expressing two distinct mutations targeting the eIF3 complex. These mutations either disrupt the entire complex or subunits positioned near the mRNA-entry channel of the ribosome which appear to relocate during or in response to mRNA binding and start-codon recognition. Disruption of either the entire eIF3 complex or specific targeting of these subunits affects mRNAs with long 5'-untranslated regions and whose translation is more dependent on eIF4A, eIF4B, and Ded1 but less dependent on eIF4G, eIF4E, and PABP. Disruption of the entire eIF3 complex further affects mRNAs involved in mitochondrial processes and with structured 5'-untranslated regions. Comparison of the suite of mRNAs most sensitive to both mutations with those uniquely sensitive to disruption of the entire complex sheds new light on the specific roles of individual subunits of the eIF3 complex. Overall design: We investigated the effects of disruption of the entire eIF3 complex or its mRNA-entry-channel arm on the translational efficiency (TE) of individual mRNAs across the transcriptome. This study includes 16 samples: 8 mRNA-seq samples and 8 ribosome footprint profiling samples, obtained from biological replicates of S. cerevisiae strains expressing either temperature-sensitive degron alleles of eIF3a and eIF3ab (eIF3a/b Degron) or a specific mutation of the eIF3i subunit (eIF3i DDKK), as well as isogenic wild-type strains for each. All strains were grown initially under permissive conditions prior to shifting to restrictive conditions for a duration resulting in approximately 80-90% reduction in global translational levels in each mutant strain."
PRJEB48183,Concerted modification of nucleotides at functional centers of the ribosome revealed by single-molecule RNA modification profiling,"Nucleotides in RNA and DNA are chemically modified by numerous enzymes that alter their function. Eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is modified at more than 100 locations, particularly at highly conserved and functionally important nucleotides. During ribosome biogenesis, modifications are added at various stages of assembly. The existence of differently modified classes of ribosomes in normal cells is unknown because no method exists to simultaneously evaluate the modification status at all sites, within a single rRNA molecule. Using a combination of yeast genetics and nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we developed a reliable method to track the modification status of single rRNA molecules at 37 sites in 18S rRNA and 73 sites in 25S rRNA. We use our method to characterize patterns of modification heterogeneity and identify concerted modification of nucleotides found near functional centers of the ribosome. Distinct undermodified subpopulations of rRNAs accumulate upon loss of Dbp3 or Prp43 RNA helicases, suggesting overlapping roles in ribosome biogenesis. Modification profiles are surprisingly resistant to change in response to many genetic and environmental conditions that affect translation, ribosome biogenesis, and pre-mRNA splicing. The ability to capture single-molecule RNA modification profiles provides new insights into the roles of nucleotide modifications in RNA function."

PRJNA785633,An adipose lncRAP2 - Igf2bp2 complex enhances adipogenesis and energy expenditure by stabilizing target mRNAs [RNA-seq],"lncRAP2 is a conserved cytoplasmic lncRNA enriched in adipose tissue and required for adipogenesis. Using purification and in vivo interactome analyses, we show that lncRAP2 forms complexes with proteins that stabilize mRNAs and modulate translation, among them Igf2bp2. Surveying transcriptome-wide Igf2bp2 client mRNAs in white adipocytes reveals selective binding to mRNAs encoding adipogenic regulators and energy expenditure effectors, including Adiponectin. These same target proteins are downregulated when either Igf2bp2 or lncRAP2 is downregulated, hindering adipocyte lipolysis. Proteomics and ribosome profiling show this occurs predominantly through mRNA accumulation, as lncRAP2-Igf2bp2 complex binding does not impact translation efficiency. Phenome-wide association studies reveal specific associations of genetic variants within both lncRAP2 and Igf2bp2 with body mass and type 2 diabetes, and both lncRAP2 and Igf2bp2 are suppressed in adipose depots of obese and diabetic individuals. Thus, the lncRAP2-Igf2bp2 complex potentiates adipose development and energy expenditure and is associated with susceptibility to obesity-linked diabetes. Overall design: RNA-seq of adipocytes differentiated in culture from directional cDNA libraries generated from poly(A)+ RNA and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument."

PRJNA784409,Angel2 phosphatase activity is required for non-canonical mitochondrial RNA processing in metazoa,"Canonical RNA processing in mammalian mitochondria necessitates that tRNAs are recognised by nucleases to release flanking transcripts. However, not all mitochondrial transcripts are punctuated by tRNAs, and the mechanism and factors involved in their processing has remained unsolved. Here, we demonstrate that phosphatase activity of the carbon catabolite repressor 4 domain containing family member ANGEL2 is required for the hydrolysis of 3' phosphates, resulting from non-canonical processing. Interaction studies in Drosophila further identify that members of the FAST kinase domain containing protein family are involved in the formation of these 3' phosphates. Our results therefore resolve the mechanism of RNA processing in metazoan mitochondria, by defining the outstanding non-canonical processing mechanism. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of two AngelKO and two wild-type samples from Drosophila melanogaster, in technical quadruplicate"
PRJEB48907,RPS15 mutations rewire RNA translation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"Recent studies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have reported recurrent mutations in the RPS15 gene, which encodes the ribosomal protein S15 (RPS15), a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Despite some evidence about the role of mutant RPS15 (mostly obtained from the analysis of cell lines), the precise impact of RPS15 mutations on the translational program in primary CLL cells remains largely unexplored. Here, using RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling, a technique that involves measuring translational efficiency, we sought to obtain global insight into changes in translation induced by RPS15 mutations in CLL cells. To this end, we evaluated primary CLL cells from patients with wildtype or mutant RPS15 as well as MEC1 CLL cells transfected with mutant or wild-type RPS15. Our data indicate that RPS15 mutations rewire the translation program of primary CLL cells by reducing their translational efficiency, an effect not seen in MEC1 cells. In detail, RPS15 mutant primary CLL cells displayed altered translation efficiency of other ribosomal proteins and regulatory elements that affect key cell processes, such as the translational machinery and immune signaling, as well as genes known to be implicated in CLL, hence highlighting a relevant role for RPS15 in the natural history of CLL."
PRJNA782905,Distinct ribosome states trigger diverse mRNA quality control pathways,"Key protein adapters couple translation to mRNA decay on specific classes of problematic mRNAs in eukaryotes. Slow decoding on nonoptimal codons leads to codon-optimality-mediated decay (COMD) and prolonged arrest at stall sites leads to no-go decay (NGD). The identities of the decay factors underlying these processes and the mechanisms by which they respond to translational distress remain open areas of investigation. We use carefully-designed reporter mRNAs to perform genetic screens and functional assays in S. cerevisiae. We characterize the roles of Hel2 and Syh1 in coordinating translational repression and mRNA decay on NGD reporter mRNAs, finding that Syh1 acts as the primary link to mRNA decay in NGD. Importantly we, observe that these NGD factors are not involved in the degradation of mRNAs enriched in nonoptimal codons. Further, we establish that key factors previously implicated in COMD, Not5 and Dhh1 , contribute modestly to the degradation of an NGD-targeted mRNA. Finally, we use ribosome profiling to reveal distinct ribosomal states associated with each reporter mRNA that readily rationalize the contributions of NGD and COMD factors to degradation of these reporters. Taken together, these results provide new mechanistic insight into the role of Syh1 in NGD and define the molecular triggers that determine how distinct pathways target mRNAs for degradation in yeast. Overall design: Monosome and disome footprint profiling was performed on yeast strains containing one of three different translation reporters (minOPT, minNONOPT, or minCGA) and in one of three different genetic backgrounds (wild-type, hel2? and syh1?). Two or three replicates per reporter/background pair were performed."
PRJNA782500,Deficiency of the RNA-binding protein Cth2 extends yeast replicative lifespan by alleviating its repressive effects on mitochondrial function,"Iron dyshomeostasis contributes to aging, but little information is available about the molecular mechanisms. Here, we provide evidence that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aging is associated with altered expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis. We further demonstrate that defects in the conserved mRNA-binding protein Cth2, which controls stability and translation of mRNAs encoding iron-containing proteins, increase lifespan by alleviating its repressive effects on mitochondrial function. Mutation of the conserved cysteine residue in Cth2 that inhibits its RNA-binding activity is sufficient to confer longevity, whereas Cth2 gain-of-function shortens replicative lifespan. Consistent with its function in RNA degradation, we demonstrate that Cth2 deficiency relieves Cth2-mediated post-transcriptional repression of nuclear-encoded components of the electron transport chain. Our findings uncover a major role of the RNA-binding protein Cth2 in the regulation of lifespan and suggest that modulation of iron starvation signaling can serve as a target for potential aging interventions. Overall design: RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq analyses of replicatively aged (OLD) and young (YNG) wild-type and cth2 knockout strains"
PRJNA782000,Boric acidon intercepts 80S ribosome migration from AUG-stop by stable eRF1 immobilization,"Upon the environmental changes, cells flexibly and rapidly alter the gene expression by the translation control. In plants, the translation of NIP5;1, a boric acid diffusion facilitator, is upregulated through the upstream open reading frame (uORF), which comprises only AUG and stop codons, in response to the shortage of boric acid. However, the molecular details of how the minimum uORF controls the translation of downstream main ORF depending on the boric acid concentration remained unclear. Here we showed that the 80S ribosome (80S) assembled at AUG-stop migrates into the subsequent RNA segment for downstream translation initiation and that the presence of boric acid impedes the process by stable confinement of eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) on 80S on AUG-stop. Ribosome profiling along the in vitro-translated reporter mRNA revealed that the number of the ribosomes on AUG-stop and that along the downstream are anti-correlated in response to boric acid, reflecting the 80S scanning leaving AUG-stop for translation initiation from downstream ORF. Moreover, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis revealed that, in the presence of boric acid, the initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAi) in the P site stably contacts eRF1 in the A site on AUG-stop. In contrast, the absence of boric acid led to weaker eRF1 density, suggesting that eRF1 cannot be stably positioned without boric acid. Consistent with the structural features, the hydrolysis of Met-tRNAi on AUG-stop was accelerated by boric acid, which is likely to be the checkpoint for the subsequent 80S scanning of the downstream. Our results provide a molecular insight into the translation regulation by a minimum and environment-responsive uORF. Overall design: Ribosome profiling"
PRJNA780800,Ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing reveal genome-wide cellular translation and transcription regulation under osmotic stress in Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103,"To determine whether osmotic pressure affects the translation efficiency of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, the ribosome profiling assay was performed to analyze the changes in translation efficiency in L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103. Under osmotic stress, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism, ribosome, and purine metabolism pathways were co-regulated with consistent expression direction at translation and transcription levels. DEGs involved in the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, and the phosphotransferase system pathways also were co-regulated at translation and transcription levels, while they showed opposite expression direction at two levels. Moreover, DEGs involved in the two-component system, amino acid metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism pathways were only regulated at the transcription level. And DEGs involved in fructose and mannose metabolism were only regulated at the translation level. The translation efficiency of DEGs involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids was downregulated while in quorum sensing and PTS pathways was upregulated. In addition, the ribosome footprints accumulated in open reading frame regions resulted in impaired translation initiation and elongation under osmotic stress. In summary, L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103 could respond to osmotic stress by translation regulation and control the balance between survival and growth of cells by transcription and translation. Overall design: To systematically investigate the effect of osmotic stress on transcription and translation regulation, RNA-seq and ribosome profiling were analyzed in the same two sets of parallel populations of L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103 cells with two different concentrations of sodium lactate (control vs. 0.6 M). Each experiment was divided into control group (CG) and osmotic stress group (OS), respectively . The regulation of transcription and translation under osmotic stress were examined by deep sequencing of cellular total mRNAs and RPFs, respectively."

PRJEB46746,Ribo-seq of human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116/L-OHP against HCT116,"Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) serves as a standard chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, while the drug resistance is still a considerable challenge. Dysregulation of lncRNA is involved in cancer and recent translatomics has found some alleged lncRNA actually contained small open reading frames and could encode short peptides. This ribosome footprint profiling (Ribo-seq) was a paired-end sequencing and aimed to investigate whether lncRNA could regulate oxaliplatin resistance in colorectal cancer by encoding short peptides."
PRJNA779948,Ribo-Seq performed in parental or CPEB4 knock-out HeLa cells,"Immediate early genes (IEGs) represent a unique class of genes with rapid induction kinetics and transient expression patterns, which requires IEG mRNAs to be short-lived. Here, we establish cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 4 (CPEB4) as a major determinant of IEG mRNA instability. We identified human CPEB4 as an RNA-binding protein (RBP) with enhanced association to poly(A) RNA upon inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), which is known to cause widespread degradation of poly(A)-containing mRNA. Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) analysis using endogenously tagged CBEP4 in HeLa cells revealed that CPEB4 preferentially binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of IEG mRNAs, at U-rich sequence motifs located in close proximity to the poly(A) site. By transcriptome-wide mRNA decay measurements, we found that the strength of CPEB4 binding correlates with short mRNA half-lives, and that loss of CBEP4 expression leads to the stabilization of IEG mRNAs. Further, we demonstrate that CPEB4 mediates mRNA degradation by recruitment of the evolutionarily conserved CCR4-NOT complex, the major eukaryotic deadenylase. While CPEB4 is primarily known for its ability to stimulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation, our findings establish an additional function for CPEB4 as an RBP that enhances the degradation of short-lived IEG mRNAs. Overall design: Preparation of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) followed by RNA-Seq to determine ribosome densities."
PRJNA779461,A dual-activity topoisomerase complex regulates mRNA translation and turnover,"Topoisomerase 3ß (TOP3B) and TDRD3 form a dual-activity topoisomerase complex that interacts with FMRP and can change the topology of both DNA and RNA.  Here, we investigated the post-transcriptional influence of TOP3B and associated proteins on mRNA translation and turnover.  First, we discovered that in human HCT116 colon cancer cells, knock-out (KO) of TOP3B had similar effects on mRNA turnover and translation as did TDRD3-KO, while FMRP-KO resulted in rather distinct effects, indicating that TOP3B had stronger coordination with TDRD3 than FMRP in mRNA regulation.  Second, we identified TOP3B-bound mRNAs in HCT116 cells; we found that while TOP3B did not directly influence the stability or translation of most TOP3B target mRNAs, it stabilized a subset of target mRNAs but had a more complex effect on translation--enhancing for some mRNAs whereas reducing for others.  Interestingly, a point mutation that specifically disrupted TOP3B catalytic activity only partially recapitulated the effects of TOP3B-KO on mRNA stability and translation, suggesting that the impact of TOP3B on target mRNAs is only in part linked to its ability to change topology of mRNAs.  Collectively, our data suggest that TOP3B-TDRD3 can regulate mRNA translation and turnover by mechanisms that are dependent and independent of topoisomerase activity. Overall design: To identify the functions of the TOP3B-TDRD3 complex on post-transcriptional regulation in HCT116 cells, total 62 samples were uploaded, including PRO-seq, RNA-seq, Ribo-seq and eCLIP-seq samples from WT and KO/KI cells. Most of them contain two or three replications. For TOP3B eCLIP-seq, TOP3B-KO cells  were used as negative controls separately. For PRO-seq, RNA-seq and Ribo-seq, wild type cells were used as controls."

PRJNA776890,Selection of cashmere fineness functional genes by translatomics,"Cashmere fineness is an important index to evaluate cashmere quality. Liaoning Cashmere Goat (LCG) has a large cashmere production and long cashmere fiber. But the fineness is not enough,improving the fineness of cashmere is an important problem.Therefore, it is important to find genes involved in cashmere fineness that can be used in future in future endeavors aiming to improve this phenotype. With the continuous advancement of research, the regulation of cashmere fineness has made new development through high-throughput sequencing and genome-wide association analysis. It has been found that translatomics can identify genes associated with phenotypic traits. Through a translatomic analysis, the skin tissue of LCG sample groups differing in cashmere fineness was sequenced by Ribo-seq. With this data, we identified 529 differentially expressed genes between the sample groups among the 27197 expressed genes(expressed,not co-expressed). From these, 343 genes were up-regulated in the fine LCG group in relation to the coarse LCG group and 186 down-regulated in the same relationship.Through GO enrichment analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential genes, the biological functions and pathways of differential genes can be found. In the GO enrichment analysis, 491 genes were significantly enriched, and the functional region was mainly in the extracellular region. In the KEGG enrichment analysis, the enrichment of human papillomavirus infection pathway was the most. We found that COL6A5 gene may affect cashmere fineness. The characteristics and expression analysis of COL6A5 gene may play an important role in the study of LCG cashmere fineness. Overall design: The genes affecting cashmere fineness were screened by translatomics in three coarse and three fine Liaoning cashmere goats."
PRJNA776169,Ribosome-bound Upf1 forms distinct 80S complexes and conducts mRNA surveillance,"Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3 are the central regulators of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), the eukaryotic mRNA quality control pathway generally triggered when a premature termination codon is recognized by the ribosome. The NMD-related functions of the Upf proteins likely commence while these factors are ribosome-associated, but little is known of the timing of their ribosome binding, their specificity for ribosomes translating NMD substrates, or the nature and role of any ribosome:Upf complexes. Here, we have elucidated details of the ribosome-associated steps of NMD. By combining yeast genetics with selective ribosome profiling and co-sedimentation analyses of polysomes with wild-type and mutant Upf proteins, our approaches have identified distinct states of ribosome:Upf association. All three Upf factors manifest progressive polysome association as mRNA translation proceeds, but these events appear to be preceded by formation of a Upf1:80S complex as mRNAs initiate translation. This complex is likely executing an early mRNA surveillance function. Overall design: We have employed selective profiling of ribosomes bound by FLAG-tagged NMD factors Upf1, Upf2, or Upf3, and of ribosomes from strains harboring NMD-altering mutations. Ribosome profiling libraries were prepared from both total and immunopurified ribosomes in duplicate or triplicate.  RNAseq libraries were prepared from cell lysates of the same strains. High throughput sequencing was performed using Illumina NextSeq500 or HiSeq4000.  The size and transcript location of ribosome protected fragments with respect to  transcript coding regions, 5' and 3'UTRs, and start or stop codons from both NMD and non-NMD substrates was determined."
PRJNA774895,Translation efficiency changes measured using ribosome footprinting (Ribo-seq) in poorly and highly metastatic cancer cells,"Cancer cells often co-opt post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to achieve pathologic expression of gene networks that drive metastasis. Translational control is a major regulatory hub in oncogenesis, however its effects on cancer progression remain poorly understood. To address this, we used ribosome profiling to compare genome-wide translation efficiencies of poorly and highly metastatic breast cancer cells and patient-derived xenografts. We developed novel regression-based methods to analyze ribosome profiling and alternative polyadenylation data, and identified HNRNPC as a translational controller of a specific mRNA regulon. Mechanistically, HNRNPC, in concert with PABPC4, binds near to poly(A) signals, thereby governing the alternative polyadenylation of a set of mRNAs. We found that HNRNPC and PABPC4 are downregulated in highly metastatic cells, which causes HNRNPC-bound mRNAs to undergo 3' UTR lengthening and subsequently, translational repression. We showed that modulating HNRNPC expression impacts the metastatic capacity of breast cancer cells in xenograft mouse models. We also found that a small molecule, previously shown to induce a distal-to-proximal poly(A) site switching, counteracts the HNRNPC-PABPC4 driven deregulation of alternative polyadenylation and decreases the metastatic lung colonization by breast cancer cells in vivo.

PRJNA774874,Concerted modification of nucleotides at functional centers of the ribosome revealed by single-molecule RNA modification profiling,"Nucleotides in RNA and DNA are chemically modified by numerous enzymes that alter their function. Eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is modified at more than 100 locations, particularly at highly conserved and functionally important nucleotides. During ribosome biogenesis, modifications are added at various stages of assembly. The existence of differently modified classes of ribosomes in normal cells is unknown because no method exists to simultaneously evaluate the modification status at all sites, within a single rRNA molecule. Using a combination of yeast genetics and nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we developed a reliable method to track the modification status of single rRNA molecules at 37 sites in 18S rRNA and 73 sites in 25S rRNA. We use our method to characterize patterns of modification heterogeneity and identify concerted modification of nucleotides found near functional centers of the ribosome. Distinct undermodified subpopulations of rRNAs accumulate upon loss of Dbp3 or Prp43 RNA helicases, suggesting overlapping roles in ribosome biogenesis. Modification profiles are surprisingly resistant to change in response to many genetic and environmental conditions that affect translation, ribosome biogenesis, and pre-mRNA splicing. The ability to capture single-molecule RNA modification profiles provides new insights into the roles of nucleotide modifications in RNA function. Overall design: We sequenced 33 samples of 18S and 25S ribosomal rRNA. 3 replicates of wild type yeast and 3 replicates of wild type shifted to cold.

Here, we report that the physiological substrate of SLFN12 RNase is tRNALeu(TAA). SLFN12 selectively digests tRNALeu(TAA), and velcrin treatment promotes the cleavage of tRNALeu(TAA) by inducing PDE3A–SLFN12 complex formation in vitro. We found that distinct sequences in the variable loop and acceptor stem of tRNALeu(TAA) are required for substrate digestion. Velcrin treatment of sensitive cells results in downregulation of tRNALeu(TAA), ribosome pausing at Leu-TTA codons and global inhibition of protein synthesis.

Here, we report that the physiological substrate of SLFN12 RNase is tRNALeu(TAA). SLFN12 selectively digests tRNALeu(TAA), and velcrin treatment promotes the cleavage of tRNALeu(TAA) by inducing PDE3A–SLFN12 complex formation in vitro. We found that distinct sequences in the variable loop and acceptor stem of tRNALeu(TAA) are required for substrate digestion. Velcrin treatment of sensitive cells results in downregulation of tRNALeu(TAA), ribosome pausing at Leu-TTA codons and global inhibition of protein synthesis. Velcrin-induced cleavage of tRNALeu(TAA) by SLFN12 and the concomitant global inhibition of protein synthesis thus define a new mechanism of apoptosis initiation.

PRJNA770675,"The context of the ribosome binding site in mRNAs defines specificity of action of kasugamycin, an inhibitor of translation initiation","Kasugamycin (KSG) is an aminoglycoside antibiotic widely used in agriculture and exhibiting considerable medical potential. Previous studies suggested that KSG interferes with translation by blocking binding of canonical mRNA and initiator tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit thereby preventing initiation of protein synthesis. Here, by using genome-wide approaches, we show that KSG can interfere with translation even after the formation of the 70S initiation complex on mRNA, as the extent of KSG-mediated translation inhibition correlates with increased occupancy of start codons by 70S ribosomes. We also show that KSG inhibits protein synthesis in a gene- and context-specific manner as even saturating concentrations of KSG do not completely abolish translation of all Escherichia coli genes. Differential action of KSG significantly depends on the nature of the mRNA residue immediately preceding the start codon, with guanine in this position being the most conducive to inhibition by the drug.  In addition, the activity of KSG is attenuated by translational coupling as genes whose start codons overlap with the coding regions or the stop codons of the upstream cistrons tend to be less susceptible to drug-mediated inhibition. Altogether, our findings reveal KSG as the first example of a small ribosomal subunit-targeting antibiotic with a well-pronounced context specificity of action. Overall design: Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and mRNA-seq data collected from E. coli ?gcvB cells grown in MOPS EZ rich defined media at mid-log phase, and the cells treated with 1 mg/ml an 10 mg/ml kasugamycin (KSG) for 2.5 min at 37°C."
PRJNA770650,Single cell quantification of ribosome occupancy in early mouse development,"Technological limitations precluded transcriptome-wide analyses of translation at single cell resolution. To solve this challenge, we developed a novel microfluidic isotachophoresis approach, named RIBOsome profiling via IsoTachoPhoresis (Ribo-ITP), and characterized translation in single oocytes and embryos during early mouse development. We identified differential translation efficiency as a key regulatory mechanism of genes involved in centrosome organization and N6-methyladenosine modification of RNAs. Our high coverage measurements enabled the first analysis of allele-specific ribosome engagement in early development and led to the discovery of stage-specific differential engagement of zygotic RNAs with ribosomes and reduced translation efficiency of transcripts with allelic-biased expression. Finally, by integrating our measurements with proteomics data, we discovered that ribosome occupancy in germinal vesicle stage oocytes is the predominant determinant of protein abundance in the zygote. The novel Ribo-ITP approach will enable numerous applications by providing high coverage and high resolution ribosome occupancy measurements from ultra-low input samples including single cells. Overall design: To study translation in mouse development, we performed our novel low-input ribosome profiling method (named Ribo-ITP) and RNA sequencing (Smart-seq3) in mouse oocytes and early stage embryos. To validate our method, we performed Ribo-ITP and conventional ribosome profiling using human K562 cells. Ribosome profiling by isotachophoresis (Ribo-ITP) of single K562 cells"
PRJNA770523,LncRNA INHEG promotes glioma stem cell maintenance and tumorigenicity through regulating rRNA 2’-O methylation,"Glioblastoma (GBM) ranks among the most lethal of human cancers, containing glioma stem cells (GSCs) that display therapeutic resistance. Here, we report that the lncRNA INHEG is highly expressed in GSCs compared to differentiated glioma cells (DGCs) and promotes GSC self-renewal through control of rRNA 2'-O-methylation. INHEG induces the interaction between a novel SUMO E3 ligase TAF15 and NOP58, a core component of snoRNP that guides rRNA methylation, to regulate NOP58 sumoylation and accelerate the C/D box snoRNP assembly. INHEG activation enhances rRNA 2'-O-methylation, thereby increasing the translation of oncogenic proteins including EGFR and IGF1R in glioma cells. Taken together, this study identifies a lncRNA that connects snoRNP-guided rRNA 2'-O-methylation to upregulated protein translation in GSCs, supporting a new axis for potential therapeutic targeting of gliomas. Overall design: We report a lncRNA that connects snoRNP-guided rRNA 2'-O-methylation to upregulated protein translation in GSCs.  To interrogate the signaling pathways modulated by methyl transferase FBL, we performed RNA-seq of 3565 and MGG4 cells with FBL knockout compared to non-targeting control.  Furthermore, we explored the RNA interactome of NOP58 using ultraviolet cross-linked immunoprecipitation followed by RNA sequencing (uvRIP-seq). We report a lncRNA that connects snoRNP-guided rRNA 2'-O-methylation to upregulated protein translation in GSCs. To investigate the role of rRNA methylation in the tumor hierarchy, we measured the rRNA 2'-O-Me levels in two matched patient-derived GSCs (3565, MGG4) and DGCs with RiboMethSeq. To interrogate the signaling pathways modulated by methyl transferase NOP58, we performed transcriptome sequencing of 3565 and MGG4 cells with NOP58 knockout compared to non-targeting control.  Furthermore, we conducted ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and RNA-seq  to identify the mRNA that lncRNA INHEG regulates."
PRJNA769692,Ribosome profiling reveals multiple roles of SecA in cotranslational protein export,"SecA, an ATPase known to posttranslationally translocate secretory proteins across the bacterial plasma membrane, also interacts with ribosomes. Here, we used a combination of ribosome profiling methods to investigate the cotranslational actions of SecA in vivo. SecA scans translating ribosomes at the plasma membrane and cotranslationally engages large periplasmic loops on inner membrane proteins. In coordination with the proton motive force, SecA resolves the cytoplasmic accumulation of periplasmic loops during cotranslational protein translocation. SecA also associates with a subset of secretory proteins at an early stage of translation and mediates their cotranslational transport, whereas the chaperone trigger factor (TF) delays SecA engagement on other secretory proteins to impose a posttranslational mode of translocation. The hydrophobicity of signal sequence is a determinant of nascent protein triage between SecA and TF. Our results elucidate the principles of SecA-driven cotranslational protein translocation and reveal a hierarchical network of protein export pathways in bacteria. Overall design: Investigating the SecA-nascent chain interactions in four different strain backgrounds (WT, ?tig, secA?ZnBD, ?secB) and in WT strain upon CCCP treatment. Monitoring cotranslational targeting events by fractionation-coupled ribosome profiling in WT strain with and without CCCP treatment (all in replicates)."

(2) T cells upregulate tRNA-m1A58 “writer” proteins TRMT61A and TRMT6 to install m1A58 modification to a specific subset of early expressed tRNAs during the early stage of activation. (3) m1A58 modifications in tRNA support rapid and adequate synthesis of MYC and other key functional proteins, guide the exit of naïve T cells from quiescence state into a proliferative state, and promote rapid T cell expansion after activation. Overall design: For RNA-seq, there are 0h,3h,6h,18h,48h for WT samples and 0h,3h,6h,48h for Trmt61A-cKO samples. For m1A-seq,there are 6h WT/cKO samples.

PRJNA766610,Start codon-associated ribosomal frameshifting mediates nutrient stress adaptation,"A translating ribosome is typically thought to follow the reading frame defined by the selected start codon. Using super-resolution ribosome profiling, here we report pervasive out-of-frame translation from the start codon. Unlike programmable frameshifting during elongation, start codon-associated ribosome frameshifting (SCARF) stems from the slippage of the initiating ribosome. Using a massively paralleled reporter assay, we uncovered sequence elements acting as SCARF enhancers or repressors, implying that start codon recognition is coupled with reading frame fidelity. This finding explains thousands of mass spectrometry spectra unannotated from human proteome. Mechanistically, we find that the eukaryotic initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) maintains the reading frame fidelity during the transition from initiation to elongation. Intriguingly, amino acid starvation induces SCARF by proteasomal degradation of eIF5B. The stress-induced SCARF products provide a degradative source to mitigate amino acid scarcity during starvation. Our findings illustrate the beneficial effect of divergent translation in nutrient stress adaptation. Overall design: Ezra-seq in different cells or mouse tissues"

PRJNA765951,Translational regulation in response to sulfur in Sorghum bicolor,"Sorghum is a C4 cereal important not only as food, but also as forage and a bioenergy resource. Its resistance to harsh environments has made it an agriculturally important research subject. Recent accumulation of genomic and transcriptomic information has facilitated genetic studies. Yet genome-wide translational profiles in sorghum are still missing, although increasing evidence has demonstrated that translation is an important regulatory step, and the transcriptome does not necessarily reflect the profile of functional protein production in some organisms. Deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (ribosome profiling, or Ribo-seq) has enabled genome-wide analysis of translation. In this study, we took advantage of Ribo-seq and identified actively translated reading frames throughout the genome. We detected translation of 7,304 main ORFs annotated in the sorghum reference genome version 3.1 and revealed a number of unannotated translational events. A comparison of the transcriptome and translatome between sorghums grown under normal and sulfur-deficient conditions revealed that gene expression is modulated independently at transcript levels and translation levels. Our study revealed the translational landscape of sorghum's response to sulfur and provides datasets that could serve as a fundamental resource to extend research on sorghum, including translational studies. Overall design: Whole shoot tissues of 13-day-after-sowing Sorghum bicolor grown under Control and sulfur deficiency conditions (Ctrl, 500 µM; Sminus, 0 µM). 3 biological replicates."

PRJNA764085,Nascent polypeptide within the exit tunnel stabilizes the ribosome to counteract risky translation,"Continuous translation elongation, irrespective of amino acid sequences, is a prerequisite for living organisms to produce their proteomes. However, the risk of elongation abortion is concealed within nascent polypeptide products. For example, negatively charged sequences with occasional intermittent prolines, termed intrinsic ribosome destabilization (IRD) sequences, destabilizes the translating ribosomal complex. Thus, some nascent chain sequences lead to premature translation cessation. Here, we show that most potential IRD sequences in the middle of open reading frames remain cryptic by two mechanisms: the nascent polypeptide itself that spans the exit tunnel and its bulky amino acid residues that occupy the tunnel entrance region. Thus, nascent polypeptide products have a built-in ability to ensure elongation continuity by serving as a bridge and thus by protecting the large and small ribosomal subunits from dissociation. Overall design: Ribosome profiling"

PRJNA763584,TRL-1 undergoes phase separation to regulate the reproduction and longevity tradeoff,"The antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging proposes that genes enhancing fitness in early life limit lifespan, but the molecular evidence remains underexplored. By profiling translatome changes in Caenorhabditis elegans during starvation recovery, we demonstrate that an open reading frame (ORF) trl-1 'hidden' within an annotated pseudogene significantly translates upon refeeding. trl-1 mutant animals increase brood sizes but shorten lifespan and specifically impair the germline deficiency-induced longevity. The loss of trl-1 abnormally upregulates the translation of vitellogenin that produces copious yolk to provision eggs, whereas vitellogenin overexpression is known to reduce lifespan. We show that TRL-1 protein undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, through which TRL-1 granules recruit vitellogenin mRNA and inhibit its translation. These results indicate that trl-1 functions as an antagonistic pleiotropic gene to regulate the reproduction-longevity tradeoff by optimizing nutrient production for the next generation. Overall design: Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq of starved six days C. elegans larvae refed with bacterial food for 0, 10, 30, and 60 minutes (min) in wide-type(N2) animals , trl-1(cas1077) animals and trl-1(cas1078) animals.

Ribo-seq generates snapshots of translating ribosomes on mRNA and therefore allows analysis of ribosome pausing mRNA. Here we performed Ribo-seq on lysates of HEK293T cells overexpressing GARS, WT or G240R, to dissect mechanism of CMT linked with translation. We found that GARS G240R causes pausing of ribosomes with glycine codons in A-site. The effect is specific for 21 nt ribosome-protected fragments, produced by ribosomes with empty A-sites, suggestive of the deficit of charged Glycyl-tRNA in GARS G240R-CMT."

PRJNA762342,Effects of tRNA[Ser]Sec anticodon stem loop modifications on selenoprotein expression,"Expression of selenoproteins requires the co-translational incorporation of selenocysteine (Sec) in response to an in-frame UGA codon. The machinery of UGA/Sec re-coding is complex and many factors affect the hierarchy of expression among selenoproteins, including modification of tRNA[Ser]Sec. Its hyper-modification in the anticodon stem loop is influenced by selenium bioavailability, and a mutation in adenosine 37 (A37) that abrogates isopentenylation, has a profound effect on selenoprotein expression in mice. Patients with mutations in tRNA-isopentenyl-transferase (TRIT1) show a severe neurological disorder and hence we wondered whether mutations in TRIT1 negatively affected the expression of selenoproteins. Fibroblasts from a patient carrying a pathogenic R323Q mutation in TRIT1 in homozygosity did not show decreased selenoprotein expression, although recombinant TRIT1R323Q had significantly reduced activity in vitro towards anticodon stem-loop substrates. We thus engineered mice conditionally deficient in Trit1 in hepatocytes and neurons. Selenoprotein expression as assessed by western blotting, 75Se metabolic labeling, and ribosomal profiling was not decreased despite the general reduction of N6-isopentenyl-adenosine in tRNAs. We show that 5-methylcarboxymethylation and 2'O-methylation of U34 occur independently of isopentenylation of A37 in tRNA[Ser]Sec. Reanalyzing previously published ribosomal profiling datasets, we demonstrate that (i) failure of 5-carboxymethylation at U34 is associated with reduced expression of GPX1, but not GPX4, and that (ii) FTSJ1 is not the elusive U34-2'O-methyltransferase involved in the methylation of tRNA[Ser]Sec.

We further find that while Eif3c loss-of-function embryos do not show a global decrease in protein synthesis, translation of Ptch1 through this pyrimidine rich motif is specifically sensitive to eIF3 amount. Altogether, this work uncovers hidden specificity of housekeeping translation initiation machinery for the translation of key developmental signaling transcripts. Overall design: eCLIP-seq"

PRJNA757962,Oligodendrocyte differentiation alters tRNA modifications and codon-dependent mRNA decay [RiboSeq],"Oligodendrocytes are specialized cells that confer neuronal myelination. Leukodystrophies associated with oligodendrocyte and hypomyelination are known to result when a number of tRNA metabolism genes are mutated. Thus, for unknown reasons, oligodendrocytes may be hypersensitive to perturbations in tRNA biology. In this study, we survey the tRNA transcriptome in the murine oligodendrocytes cell lineage in an effort to understanding the molecular underpinning for human disease. We find that specific tRNAs are hypomodified in oligodendrocytes within or near the anticodon. This hypomodified state may be the result of differential expression of key modification enzymes during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Moreover, we observe a concomitant relationship between tRNA hypomodification and tRNA decoding potential; observing oligodendrocyte specific alterations in codon optimality-mediated mRNA decay and ribosome transit. Our results reveal that oligodendrocytes naturally maintain a delicate, hypersensitized tRNA/mRNA axis. We suggest this axis underlies disease etiology when further insult to tRNA metabolism is introduced.

PRJNA757274,Single-cell profiling of human bone marrow progenitors reveals mechanisms of failing erythropoiesis in Diamond-Blackfan anemia,"Ribosome dysfunction underlies the pathogenesis of many cancers and heritable ribosomopathies. Here we investigate how mutations in either ribosomal protein large (RPL) or ribosomal protein small (RPS) subunit genes selectively affect erythroid progenitor development and clinical phenotypes in Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a rare ribosomopathy with limited therapeutic options. Using single-cell assays of patient-derived bone marrow, we delineated two distinct cellular trajectories segregating with ribosomal protein genotypes: almost complete loss of erythroid specification were observed in RPS-DBA. In contrast, we observed relative preservation of qualitatively abnormal erythroid progenitors and precursors in RPL-DBA. Although both DBA genotypes exhibited a pro-inflammatory bone marrow milieu, RPS-DBA was characterized by erythroid differentiation arrest, whereas RPL-DBA was characterized by preserved GATA1 expression and activity. Compensatory stress erythropoiesis in RPL-DBA exhibited disordered differentiation underpinned by an altered glucocorticoid molecular signature, including reduced ZFP36L2 expression, leading to milder anemia and improved corticosteroid response. This integrative analysis approach identified distinct pathways of erythroid failure and defined genotype-phenotype correlations in DBA. These findings may help facilitate therapeutic target discovery. Overall design: Directional paired-end bulk RNAseq of CD34-Lin-CD71+GYPA+ erythroblasts FACS-isolated from human bone marrow from healthy controls (n=3) and patients with Diamond- Blackfan anemia (n=3 transfusion-dependent; n=1 transfusion independent and n=1 steroid-dependent)"

PRJNA754447,Global and gene-specific translational regulation in Escherichia coli across different conditions,"How well mRNA transcript levels represent protein abundances has been a controversial issue. Particularly across different environments, correlations between mRNA and protein exhibit remarkable variability from gene to gene. Translational regulation is likely to be one of the key factors contributing to mismatches between mRNA level and protein abundance. Here, we quantified genome-wide transcriptome and relative translation efficiency (RTE) under 12 different conditions in Escherichia coli. By quantifying the mRNA-RTE correlation both across genes and across conditions, we uncovered a diversity of gene-specific translational regulations, cooperating with transcriptional regulations, in response to carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphate (P) limitations. Intriguingly, we found that many genes regulating translation are themselves subject to translational regulation, suggesting possible direct feedbacks. Furthermore, we observed that genes with similar expression patterns share similar codon usage. Utilizing a random forest model, we confirmed that codon usage contributes to condition-dependent translational regulation. These findings broaden the understanding of translational regulation under environmental changes, and provide novel strategies for the control of translation in synthetic biology.

PRJNA753526,Transcription-wide distribution of dihydrouridine (D) into mRNAs reveals its requirement for meiotic chromosome segregation [Ribo/RNA-seq],"Here we have developed Rho-seq, an integrated pipeline detecting a range of modifications through differential modification-dependent Rhodamine labeling. Using Rho-seq, we report that the reduction of uridine to dihydrouridine by the Dus reductase family targets tRNAs in E. coli but expands to mRNAs is yeast. The modified mRNAs are enriched for cytoskeleton related encoded protein. We show that the a-tubulin encoding mRNA nda2 undergoes dihydrouridination, which affects its protein expression level. The absence of the modification onto the nda2 mRNA strongly impacts meiosis by inducing a metaphase delay or by completely preventing the formation of spindles during meiosis I and meiosis II, eventually resulting in low gamete viability. Collectively these data show that the codon specific reduction of uridine within mRNA is required for proper meiotic chromosome segregation and gamete viability. Overall design: Ribo-seq and total RNA-seq for matching samples of wild-type and delta4dus S. pombe cells"

We further performed the ribosome profiling and RNA-seq libraries sequenced to globally identify the mRNAs that the peptie targeted. Interestingly, the ribo-seq data has shown that a large number of mRNAs were significantly downregulated in the peptide-knockdown samples. Finally, we discovered that high expression of the peptide supported a specific translation program to facilitate cancer progression. Overall design: Sh-NC and sh-Speptide MOLM-13 cells used"
PRJNA753469,Optimisation of ribosome footprinting conditions for Ribo-Seq in human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells,"Our understanding of mRNA translation and its regulation has been transformed by the development of Ribosome profiling. This approach relies upon RNaseI footprinting of translating ribosomes in a precise manner to generate an accurate snapshot of ribosome positions with nucleotide resolution. Here we tested a variety of conditions, which contribute to the preciseness of ribosome footprinting and therefore the success of ribosome profiling. We found that NaCl concentration, RNaseI source, RNaseI amount and temperature of footprinting all contributed to the quality of ribosome footprinting in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. These ideal conditions for footprinting also improved footprint quality when used with Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. Footprinting under the same conditions generated different footprints sizes and framing patterns in human and D. melanogaster cells. We also found that treatment of S2 cells with cycloheximide prior to footprinting impacted the distribution of footprints across ORFs, without affecting overall read length distribution and framing pattern, as previously found in other organisms. Together our results indicate that a variety of factors affect ribosome footprint quality and the nature of precise footprinting varies across species."

PRJNA752135,Sulforaphane Reduces Obesity by Reversing Leptin Resistance,"Introduction: The ascending prevalence of obesity in recent decades is commonly associated with soaring rates of morbidity and mortality resulting in increased health care costs and decreased quality of life. A systemic state of stress characterized by low grade inflammation and pathologic formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) usually manifest in obesity. The transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) is the master regulator of the redox homeostasis and plays a critical role in the resolution of inflammation. Our results indicate that the natural isothiocyanate and potent NRF2 activator sulforaphane reverses the diet-induced obesity in rodents and implicate involvement of leptin receptor singling in this effect. Purpose: Here, we investigate molecular pathways underlying the effects of sulforaphane in reversing diet-induced obesity and interrogate potential pathways that link NRF2 with leptin receptor signaling by conducting whole transcriptome analysis in 6 metabolically active tissues from the diet-induced obese mice that were treated with SFN. Methods: Male 12-week-old C57/BJ wild type mice were fed with high fat diet for 16-20 weeks. Around 28 weeks of age, mice were treated with daily ip injections of either SFN (5 mg/kg) or vehicle for one week. We probed the whole transcriptome in several metabolic tissues including the hypothalamus, liver, brown adipose tissue (BAT), epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), and skeletal muscle following peripheral SFN administration. Total RNA samples from each tissue were prepared with Trizol. Whole transcriptome were conducted by using Novogene sequencing platform NovaSeq 6000 PE150. The following bioinformatics analysis have been conducted. 1. Data Quality Control: filtering reads containing adapter or with low quality. 2. Statistics Analysis of Data Production and Quality. 3. Mapping Reads to Reference Genome. 4. Gene Expression Quantification. 5. Correlation analysis (For biological replicates only). 6. Differential Expression Analysis (two or more groups of samples). 7. GO Enrichment Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) (two or more groups of samples). 8. KEGG Pathway Enrichment Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) (two or more groups of samples). 9. GSEA Enrichment Analysis of Expressed Genes (two or more groups of samples). 10. Protein Protein Interaction Analysis. 11. Reactome Pathway Enrichment Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) (two or more groups of samples and only for mouse samples). 12. Oncogene Functional Annotation analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) (two or more groups of samples and only for mouse sample). Results: RNAseq results indicated a significant upregulation of the NRF2 target gene HMOX1 only in the skeletal muscle. We also conducted an enrichment analysis to identify potential transcription factors for the significantly upregulated genes. NRF2 was identified as the most significant transcription factor only for the skeletal muscle gene set, providing further support for the skeletal muscle being a primary target tissue of SFN action. We thus conducted a KEGG and GO pathway analysis, and identified ribosome biogenesis, proteasome pathway, and the RNA transport as the significantly upregulated pathways in the SFN-treated muscle samples. In addition to HMOX1, the RNA seq results indicate upregulation of other genes involved in oxidative stress response capacity in SFN treated mice in the skeletal muscle. GCLM (glutamate-cysteine ligase), the first rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione synthesis, SRXN1 (Sulfiredoxin), an oxidoreductase that reduces cysteine-sulfinate, and GSR (glutathione-disulfide reductase), a central antioxidant enzyme, which reduces oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl form glutathione (GSH), and TXNRD1 (thioredoxin reductase 1) which reduces thioredoxins are all upregulated in the skeletal muscle of the SFN-treated DIO animals. Conclusions: Here, we show that the natural isothiocyanate and potent NRF2 activator sulforaphane reverses diet-induced obesity through an NRF2-dependent mechanism that requires a functional leptin receptor signaling and hyperleptinemia. Transcriptional profiling of six major metabolically relevant tissues highlights that sulforaphane suppresses fatty acid synthesis while promoting ribosome biogenesis, reducing ROS accumulation and resolving inflammation, therefore representing a unique transcriptional program that leads to protection from obesity. Our findings argue for clinical evaluation of sulforaphane for weight loss and obesity-associated metabolic disorders. Overall design: Transcriptome profiles in 6 metabolically active tissues of sulforaphane-treated diet-induced obese 28-week-old wild type (WT) mice."

PRJNA750636,Integrated transcriptomic and translatomic exploration of the effect of betaine on lipid metabolic dysregulation induced by a high-fat diet,"An excessive high-fat/energy diet is a major cause of obesity and associated complications, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Betaine has been shown to effectively improve hepatic lipid metabolism. However, the mechanistic basis for this improvement is largely unknown. Herein, integration of transcriptomics sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome footprints profiling (Ribo-seq) was used to investigate the means by which betaine alleviates hepatic lipid metabolic disorders induced by a high-fat diet. For the transcriptome, gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated betaine to reduce liver steatosis by up-regulation of fatty acid beta oxidation, lipid oxidation, and fatty acid catabolic processes. For the translatome, 574 differentially expressed genes were identified, 17 of which were associated with the NAFLD pathway. By combined analysis of RNA-seq and Ribo-seq, we found that betaine had the greatest effect on NAFLD at the translational level. Further, betaine decreased translational efficiency (TE) for IDI1, CYP5A1, TM7SF2, and APOA4, which are related to lipid biosynthesis. In summary, this study demonstrates betaine to alleviate lipid metabolic dysfunction at the translational level. The powerful multi-omics data integration approach used herein provides for a new understanding of the means by which to treat NAFLD. Overall design: High-throughput sequencing of liver tissue from high-fat and betaine treated high-fat mice."
PRJNA750456,Dynamic O-GlcNAcylation of eIF3a controls translation reinitiation during integrated stress response,"In eukaryotic cells, many mRNAs possess upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in addition to the main coding region. After uORF translation, the ribosome could either recycle at the stop codon or resume scanning for downstream start codons in a process known as reinitiation. Accumulating evidence suggests that some initiation factors, including eIF3, linger on the early elongating ribosome, forming an eIF3-80S complex. Very little is known how the eIF3 is carried along with the 80S during elongation and its implications in subsequent translation reinitiation. Here we report that eIF3a undergoes dynamic O-GlcNAc modification in response to nutrient starvation. Stress-induced de-O-GlcNAcylation promotes eIF3 retention on the elongating ribosome and facilitates reinitiation at downstream start codons. Eliminating the modification site from eIF3a via genome editing induces ATF4 reinitiation under the nutrient rich condition. Our findings illustrate a mechanism in balancing ribosome recycling and reinitiation, thereby linking integrated stress response and translational reprogramming. Overall design: Ribo-seq and eIF3-seq of WT and OTG knockout MEF cells with or without starvation, and with or without ThiametG treatment."
PRJNA750140,RBM17 Mediates Evasion of Pro-Leukemic Factors from Splicing-coupled NMD to Enforce Leukemic Stem Cell Maintenance,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients suffer from chemo-resistance, high relapse frequency, and low overall survival rate, outcomes driven by leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that support these primitive leukemic cells is crucial for developing effective AML therapeutics. In the present study, we demonstrate that upregulation of the splicing factor RBM17 preferentially marks and sustains the primitive compartment of AML. RBM17 expression is significantly higher in LSCs and its levels in human AML directly correlate with shortened survival in patients with the disease. RBM17 knockdown in primitive primary AML cells leads to myeloid differentiation and the impairment of their in vitro colony forming and in vivo engraftment capacities. To study the molecular mechanisms underlying the functional roles of RBM17 in AML, we performed global profiling of the RBM17-RNA interactome and proteome changes downstream of RBM17 knockdown. Through these integrative multi-omics analyses, we show that RBM17 repression leads to inclusion of poison exons and production of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-sensitive transcripts for pro-leukemic factors such as RBM39 and EZH2, along with the translation initiation factor EIF4A2. We further show that EIF4A2 expression is enriched in LSCs and inhibition of EIF4A2 impairs primary AML progenitor activity. Proteome analysis of AML cells after EIF4A2 knockdown demonstrate that EIF4A2 repression largely recapitulates the biological effect of RBM17 knockdown including the pronounced suppression of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis. Overall, these results provide a rationale to target RBM17 and/or its downstream NMD-sensitive splicing substrates in primitive leukemic cells for AML treatment. Overall design: eCLIP-seq against RBM17 in K562 cells."
PRJNA749454,Queuosine-tRNA promotes sex-dependent learning and memory formation by maintaining codon-biased translation elongation speed.,"Queuosine (Q) is a modified nucleoside at the wobble position of specific tRNAs. In mammals, queuosinylation is facilitated by queuine uptake from the gut microbiota and is introduced into tRNA by the QTRT1-QTRT2 enzyme complex. By establishing a Qtrt1 knockout mouse model, we discovered that the loss of QtRNA leads to learning and memory deficits. Ribo-Seq analysis in the hippocampus of Qtrt1-deficient mice revealed not only stalling of ribosomes on Q-decoded codons but also a global imbalance in translation elongation speed between codons that engage in weak and strong interactions with their cognate anticodons. While Qdependent molecular and behavioral phenotypes were identified in both sexes, female mice were affected more severely than males. Proteomics analysis confirmed deregulation of synaptogenesis and neuronal morphology. Together, our findings provide a link between tRNA modification and brain functions and reveal an unexpected role of protein synthesis in sex-dependent cognitive performance. Overall design: Cytoplasmic RNA and Cytoplasmic RNA protected by ribosomes from RNase I (Ribonuclease I) cleavage, were sequenced. Small RNA libraries were performed according to the protocol using NEB NEXT Small RNA library Prep Set for Illumina (Multiplex Compatible) E7330, and size-selected (120-170 base pairs) before sequencing."
PRJNA749295,Myocardial cellular gene expression during pressure overload: evidence for transient partial endothelial to mesenchymal transition [Ribo-seq],"Pathological processes underlying pressure overload triggered heart failure were mainly analyzed from a cardiomyocyte centric view. To identify new cellular mechanisms, we isolated cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts as most abundant cardiac cell types from mice in the subacute and chronic stages of pressure overload (by transverse aortic constriction, TAC) and performed RNA-sequencing. We detected highly cell-type specific transcriptional responses with characteristic time courses and active intercellular communication, especially early after TAC. We focused on endothelial cells, and single-cell sequencing in this population showed enhanced expression of collagens and inflammatory mediators at this stage. Importantly, these endothelial transcriptional changes were transduced to the translational level as shown by Ribo-Tag sequencing and verification of collagen protein production by cardiac endothelial cells. In conclusion, we provide a resource of cardiac cellular gene expression in pressure overload and reveal the induction of collagens by endothelial cells as potential therapeutic target. Overall design: Ribo-tag mice were crossed with Cdh5-CreERT2 mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the Cadherin 5 (Cdh5) promoter (Cdh5-CreERT2:Ribo-tag).

PRJNA748395,Bacterial ribosome pause sites surveyed by an integration of ribosome profiling and nascent chain profiling II,"Ribosome pauses are associated with diverse co-translational events and determine the fate of mRNAs and proteins. Thus the identification of the precise pause sites across transcriptome is a key, however, the landscape in bacterial has remained ambiguous. Here, we harnessed the multiple ribosome profiling strategies (standard, high-salt-wash, and disome) to survey the robust ribosome pause sites in E. coli. The found pause sites showed the correspondence with biochemical validation by integrated nascent chain profiling (iNP), which detects polypeptidyl-tRNA, an elongation intermediate. Among the list, ribosome pause at Asn586 of ycbZ was ensured by biochemical reporter assay, tRNA-seq, and cryo-electron microscopy. Our results provide a useful resource of ribosome stalling sites in bacteria. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of monosome is mono-ribosome (we analyzed ribosome footprints derived from one ribosome in the library), and disome is di-ribosome (we analyzed ribosome footprints derived from collied ribosomes in the library). Both samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen."
PRJNA748058,Balancing of mitochondrial translation through METTL8-mediated m3C modification of mitochondrial tRNAs,"Mitochondria contain a specific translation machinery for the synthesis of respiratory chain components encoded on the mitochondrial genome. Mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) are also generated from the mitochondrial genome and, similar to their cytoplasmic counterparts, are modified at various positions. Here, we find that the RNA methyltransferase METTL8, is a mitochondrial protein that facilitates m3C methylation at position C32 of mt-tRNASer(UCN) and mt-tRNAThr. METTL8 knock out cells show reduced and over expressing cells enhanced respiratory chain activity. In pancreatic cancer, METTL8 levels are high, which correlates with patient survival. Indeed, METTL8 up regulation stimulates respiratory chain activity in these cells. Ribosome occupancy analysis using ribosome profiling revealed ribosome stalling on mt-tRNASer(UCN) and mt-tRNAThr codons and mass spectrometry analysis of native ribosomal subcomplexes unraveled reduced respiratory chain incorporation of the mitochondria encoded proteins ND6 and ND1. A well-balanced translation of mt-tRNASer(UCN) and mt-tRNAThr codons through METTL8-mediated C32 methylation might therefore provide optimal respiratory chain compositions and function. Overall design: 4 mitoribosome profiling datasets of HEK293 cells. One control dataset, two biological replicates containing METTL8 knockouts, and one with a inducible METTL8 overexpression"
PRJEB46152,Pervasive Translation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"The vast majority of bacterial open reading frames (ORFs) are identified by automated prediction algorithms. However, these algorithms fail to identify ORFs that deviate from the canonical features of ORFs such as a length of >50 codons, and the presence of an upstream Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Here, we use ribosome profiling approaches to experimentally identify actively translated ORFs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Most of the ORFs we identify have not been previously described, indicating that the M. tuberculosis transcriptome is pervasively translated. Moreover, the newly described ORFs are predominantly short, with many encoding proteins of =50 amino acids. The codon usage of the newly discovered ORFs suggests that most are not undergoing purifying selection, and hence are unlikely to contribute to cell fitness. Nevertheless, we identify ~90 new ORFs, with a median length of 52 codons, that bear the hallmarks of purifying selection. Thus, our data suggest that pervasive translation of short ORFs serves as a rich source for the evolution of new functional proteins"
PRJNA747247,Developmental Dynamics of RNA Translation in the Human Brain,"The precise regulation of gene expression is fundamental to neurodevelopment, plasticity, and cognitive function. While several studies have profiled transcription in the developing human brain, there is a gap in our understanding of accompanying translational regulation. We performed ribosome profiling on 73 human prenatal and adult cortex samples. We characterized the translational regulation of annotated open reading frames (ORFs) and identified thousands of previously unknown translation events, including small ORFs that give rise to human- and/or brain-specific microproteins, many of which we independently verified using proteomics. Ribosome profiling in stem cell-derived human neuronal cultures corroborated these findings and revealed that several neuronal activity-induced non-coding RNAs encode previously undescribed microproteins. Physicochemical analysis of brain microproteins identified a class of proteins that contain arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) repeats and thus may be regulators of RNA metabolism.  This resource expands the known translational landscape of the human brain and illuminates previously unknown brain-specific protein products. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of cultured human embryonic stem cell derived neurons"
PRJNA747022,Ribosome impairment regulates intestinal stem cell identity via ZAKɑ activation,"We show that ribosome collisions, induced by Rptor deletion or aminoacid starvation, causes a ZAK alpha mediated identity switch in intestinal stem cells by activating a more fetal-like stem cell signature. This switch also causes changes in metabolic profiles of the cells, which is heavily regulated by RNA translation efficiency of different group of metabolic genes. These observations originate from performing in vitro Riboseq and RNAseq in mouse intestinal organoids, and in vivo Riboseq in Lgr5 expressing intestinal stem cells from WT and Rptor.fl/fl mice. Overall design: In vitro Ribo-seq and RNAseq in WT-stem cell enriched, WT-stem cell depleted and Rptor fl/fl mouse intestinal organoids. In vitro RNAseq in WT mouse intestinal organoids. In vivo Ribo-seq in Lgr5 expressing intestinal stem cells from WT and Rptor fl/fl mouse."
PRJNA745343,METTL18-mediated histidine methylation on RPL3 modulates translation elongation for proteostasis maintenance,"In addition to predominant protein methylation on lysine and arginine residues, histidine also serves as a substrate for the modification. However, a limited number of enzymes responsible for this modification has been reported. Moreover, the biological mission of the histidine methylation has remained poorly understood. Here, we reported that human METTL18 is a histidine methyltransferase for ribosomal protein RPL3 and that the modification specifically slows ribosome traverse on tyrosine codons, allowing proper folding of synthesized proteins. Harnessing in vitro methylation assay with methyl-donor analogue and quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified that His245 of RPL3 is methylated at t-N position by METTL18. Structural comparison of the modified and unmodified ribosomes showed the stoichiometric modification and suggested its role in translation tuning. Indeed, genome-wide ribosome profiling revealed the suppressed ribosomal translocation at tyrosine codons by RPL3 methylation. Because the slower elongation provides enough time for nascent protein folding, RPL3 methylation protects cells from cellular aggregation of Tyr-rich proteins. Our results reveal histidine methylation as an example of “ribosome code”, which ensures proteome integrity in cells. Overall design: Ribosome profiling"
PRJNA744888,Novel RNA-binding Proteins Bind U1 snRNA to Promote Splicing of Weak 5' Splice Sites,"Removal of introns during pre-mRNA splicing, which is central to gene expression, initiates by base pairing of U1 snRNA with a 5' splice site (5'SS). In mammals, many introns contain weak 5'SSs that are not efficiently recognized by the canonical U1 snRNP, suggesting alternative mechanisms exist. Here, we develop a cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled to a high-throughput sequencing method, BCLIP-seq, to identify NRDE2 (Nuclear RNAi defective-2) and CCDC174 (Coiled-Coil Domain-Containing 174) as novel RNA-binding proteins in mouse ES cells that associate with U1 snRNA and unspliced 5'SSs. Both proteins bind directly to U1 snRNA independently of canonical U1 snRNP specific proteins, and they are required for the selection and effective processing of weak 5'SSs. Our results reveal that mammalian cells use non-canonical splicing factors bound directly to U1 snRNA to effectively select suboptimal 5'SS sequences in hundreds of genes, promoting proper splice site choice and accurate pre-mRNA splicing. Overall design: All BCLIP-seq, RNA-seq and Ribo-seq experiments were performed in two independent replicates for each sample. BCLIP-seq was done with proteins endogenously tagged with a composite 3xFLAG+AviTag (3A tag). Nrde2 and Mtrex knockout were induced by treating the conditional knockout mES cells with 100 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 4 and 3 days, respectively. Depletion of all the proteins fused to FKBP12F36V degron was achieved by treating the cells with 500 nM dTAG-13 compound for 24 hours. The indicated RNA-seq samples were treated for 4 hours with 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide (CHX)."
PRJNA744552,Ribosome collisions in bacteria promote ribosome rescue by triggering mRNA cleavage by SmrB,"Ribosome rescue pathways recycle stalled ribosomes and target problematic mRNAs and aborted proteins for degradation. In bacteria, it remains unclear how rescue pathways distinguish ribosomes stalled in the middle of a transcript from actively translating ribosomes. In a genetic screen in E. coli, we discovered a novel rescue factor that has endonuclease activity. SmrB cleaves mRNAs upstream of stalled ribosomes, allowing the ribosome rescue factor tmRNA (which acts on truncated mRNA) to rescue upstream ribosomes. SmrB is recruited by ribosome collisions. Cryo-EM structures of collided disomes from E. coli and B. subtilis reveal interactions between the 30S subunits and a possible SmrB binding site. These findings show that ribosome collisions trigger ribosome rescue in bacteria and reveal the mechanism by which this occurs. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of four strains expressing a reporter construct with a short SecM stalling motif from the plasmid IRAGP_reporter in four strains: Wild-type MG1655, delta-ssrA, delta-smrB, and the double knockout delta-ssrA delta-smrB."
PRJNA744147,Monitoring the 5′UTR landscape reveals isoform switches to drive translational efficiencies in cancer,"Transcriptional and translational control are key determinants of gene expression, however, to what extent these two processes can be collectively coordinated is still poorly understood. Here, we use Nanopore long-read sequencing and cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE-seq) to document the landscape of 5' and 3' untranslated region (UTR) isoforms and transcription start sites of epidermal stem cells, wild-type keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinomas. Focusing on squamous cell carcinomas, we show that a small cohort of genes with alternative 5'UTR isoforms exhibit overall increased translational efficiencies and are enriched in ribosomal proteins and splicing factors. By combining polysome fractionations and CAGE-seq, we further characterize two of these UTR isoform genes with identical coding sequences and demonstrate that the underlying transcription start site heterogeneity frequently results in 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) and pyrimidine-rich translational element (PRTE) motif switches to drive mTORC1-dependent translation of the mRNA. Genome-wide, we show that highly translated squamous cell carcinoma transcripts switch towards increased use of 5'TOP and PRTE motifs, have generally shorter 5'UTRs and expose decreased RNA secondary structures. Notably, we found that the two 5'TOP motif-containing, but not the TOP-less, RPL21 transcript isoforms strongly correlated with overall survival in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. Our findings warrant isoform-specific analyses in human cancer datasets and suggest that switching between 5'UTR isoforms is an elegant and simple way to alter protein synthesis rates, set their sensitivity to the mTORC1-dependent nutrient-sensing pathway and direct the translational potential of an mRNA by the precise 5'UTR sequence. Overall design: RNA from mouse P56-60 epidermis, cultured WT and HRASG12V; TGFBR-2 KO keratinocytes was isolated and used for NANOPORE long-read RNA sequencing. Cultured WT and HRASG12V; TGFBR-2 KO keratinocytes were used for ribosome profiling and short-read RNA sequencing."
PRJEB39403,Ribosome profiling of Japanese encephalitis virus infected Neuro2a cells,"Ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) and RNA-Seq analysis of mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro2a) cells infected with Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) P20778 Vellore strain. At 18 h post infection (p.i.), infected cells were treated with either cycloheximide (translation elongation inhibitor) or in combination with harringtonine (translation initiation inhibitor). Ribo-Seq libraries were prepared using a broad range of fragment lengths (25 to 70 nucleotides) and deep sequenced. This allowed for estimation of ribosomal frameshifting efficiency and discovery of a novel upstream open reading frame (uORF) in JEV along with perturbations in ribosome-associated tRNA levels upon JEV infection."

PRJNA740301,Compromised nonsense-mediated RNA decay results in truncated RNA-binding protein production upon DUX4 expression,"Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) degrades transcripts carrying premature termination codons. NMD is thought to prevent the synthesis of toxic truncated proteins. However, whether loss of NMD results in widespread production of truncated proteins is unclear. A human genetic disease, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), features acute inhibition of NMD upon expression of the disease-causing transcription factor, DUX4. Using a cell-based model of FSHD, we show production of truncated proteins from physiological NMD targets and find that RNA-binding proteins are enriched for aberrant truncations. The NMD isoform of one RNA-binding protein, SRSF3, is translated to produce a stable truncated protein, which is detected in FSHD patient-derived myotubes. Ectopic expression of truncated SRSF3 confers toxicity, and its downregulation is cytoprotective. Our results delineate the genome-scale impact of NMD loss. This widespread production of potentially deleterious truncated proteins has implications for FSHD biology as well as other genetic diseases where NMD is therapeutically modulated. Overall design: Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) of human myoblasts harboring an inducible DUX4 transgene was performed on ribosome-protected RNA samples collected from 3 separate biological replicates treated for 0, 4, 8, or 14 h with doxycycline to induce DUX4 expression."
PRJNA740184,Structured elements drive extensive circular RNA translation,"The human genome encodes tens of thousands circular RNAs (circRNAs) with mostly unknown functions. Circular RNAs requires internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) if they are to undergo translation without 5' cap. Here, we develop a high-throughput screen to systematically discover RNA sequences that can direct circRNA translation in human cells. We identify over 17,000 endogenous and synthetic sequences as candidate circRNA IRES. 18S rRNA complementarity and a structured RNA element positioned on the IRES are important for driving circRNA translation. Ribosome profiling and peptidomic analyses show extensive IRES-ribosome association, hundreds of circRNA-encoded proteins with tissue -specific distribution, and antigen presentation. We find that circFGFR1p, a protein encoded by circFGFR1 that is down regulated in cancer, functions as a negative regulator of FGFR1 oncoprotein to suppress cell growth during stress.  Systematic identification of circRNA IRES elements may provide important links among circRNA regulation, biological function, and disease. Overall design: High-throughput oligo-split-eGFP-circRNA reporter screening assay for obtaining cap-independent translation measurements of 55,000 fully designed sequences in parallel on circRNA using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and high-throughput DNA sequencing (FACS-seq)."

PRJEB38328,Haploinsufficiency of ribosomal genes limits the viability of monosomic human cells by activation of the p53 pathway,"Chromosome loss that results in monosomy has detrimental consequences for human cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain enigmatic. Using p53 deficient monosomic cell lines, we found that chromosome loss impairs proliferation and genomic stability. Transcriptome and proteome analysis revealed a partial compensation of the gene dosage changes that mitigates the effects of chromosome loss. Monosomy triggers global gene expression changes that differ from the effects of trisomy. Strikingly, ribosome biogenesis and translation were commonly downregulated in monosomic cells. Polysome profiling and translation analysis suggest that the defects arise due to haploinsufficiency of ribosomal genes. The ensuing ribosome biogenesis stress triggers the p53 pathway and G1 arrest when TP53 is reintroduced into monosomic cells. Accordingly, impaired ribosome biogenesis and p53 inactivation are associated with monosomy in cancer. Our first systematic study of monosomy in human cells demonstrates that haploinsufficiency of ribosomal genes presents a dominant negative phenotype of monosomy."

PRJNA737119,A stem cell roadmap of ribosome heterogeneity reveals a function for RPL10A in mesoderm production,"Recent findings suggest that the ribosome itself modulates gene expression. However, whether ribosomes change composition across cell types or control cell fate remains unknown. Here, employing quantitative mass spectrometry during human embryonic stem cell differentiation, we identify dozens of ribosome composition changes underlying cell fate specification. We observe upregulation of RPL10A/uL1-containing ribosomes in the primitive streak followed by progressive decreases during mesoderm differentiation. An Rpl10a loss-of-function allele in mice causes striking early mesodermal phenotypes, including posterior trunk truncations, and inhibits paraxial mesoderm production in culture.  Ribosome profiling in Rpl10a loss-of-function mice reveals decreased translation of mesoderm regulators, including Wnt pathway mRNAs, which are also enriched on RPL10A/uL1-containing ribosomes. We further show that RPL10A/uL1 regulates canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling during stem cell differentiation and in the developing embryo.  These findings reveal unexpected ribosome composition modularity that controls differentiation and development through the specialized translation of key signaling networks. Overall design: Ribosome profiling from E8.5 Rpl10a +/+ and Rpl10a LOF/LOF embryos (N=3 of each genotype)"
PRJNA735209,Role of eEF2 diphthamide modification in translational fidelity,"Diphthamide (DPH) is a conserved amino acid modification on eukaryotic translation elongation factor eEF2. We show that loss of DPH increases -1 ribosomal frameshifting at both programmed, including in SARS-CoV-2, and non-programmed sites. Ribosome profiling of yeast and mammalian cells lacking DPH reveals increased ribosomal drop-off during elongation. The drop-off defect on the long yeast MDN1 gene was suppressed by eliminating out-of-frame stop codons. Our data reveal that loss of DPH impairs the fidelity of translocation during translation elongation resulting in increased rates of ribosomal frameshifting and premature termination at out-of-frame stop codons. Overall design: Examination of yeast and mammalian cells lacking diphthamide modification in eEF2"

To identify the mechanism underlying LARS-mediated breast tumor suppression, we first conducted charged tRNA profiling to assess charged and total tRNA-Leu expression in cell lines with high and low LARS expression. Expression of select charged and total tRNA-Leu isoacceptors were reduced in cell lines with lower LARS expression. We then conducted RNA-Seq and translation profiling including ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq), polysome profiling in LARS-depleted cell lines. To test our hypothesis in vivo, we also performed RNA-Seq of ribosome-associated RNAs in Lars depleted PyMT tumors within RiboTag mice. The analyses implicate LARS as a regulator of leucine-rich translation. Overall design: To identify changes in tRNA-Leu expression, charged tRNA profiling was conducted in LARS-high non-transformed mcf10a cells compared to LARS-low HCC1806 breast cancer cells using charged tRNA profiling. To identify the impact of LARS on protein translation, RNA-Seq, Ribo-Seq and Polysome profiling were conducted in LARS-depleted 4T07 breast cancer cells. To assess the effects of LARS on translation in vivo, RNA-Seq was conducted on ribosome-associated mRNAs isolated from RiboTag mice harboring PyMT tumors, with and without monoallelic LARS deletion in the mammary tumor compartment."
PRJNA734658,Bi-directional ribosome scanning controls the stringency of start codon selection,"The fidelity of start codon recognition by ribosomes is paramount during protein synthesis. The textbook knowledge of eukaryotic translation initiation depicts 5'?3' unidirectional migration of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) along the 5'UTR. In probing translation initiation from ultra-short 5'UTR, we report that an AUG triplet near the 5' end can be selected via PIC backsliding. The bi-directional ribosome scanning is supported by competitive selection of closely spaced AUG codons and recognition of two initiation sites flanking an internal ribosome entry site. Transcriptome-wide PIC profiling reveals footprints with an oscillation pattern near the 5' end and start codons. Depleting the RNA helicase eIF4A leads to reduced PIC oscillations and impaired selection of 5' end start codons. Enhancing the ATPase activity of eIF4A promotes nonlinear PIC scanning and stimulates upstream translation initiation. The helicase-mediated PIC conformational switch may provide an operational mechanism that unifies ribosome recruitment, scanning, and start codon selection. Overall design: Ribo-seq, 40S-seq and eIF3-seq of MEF and HEK293 cells with or without eIF4A1"
PRJNA734003,Function and Mechanism of METTL5-mediated 18S rRNA m6A1832 modification in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Tumor recurrence is main pattern of treatment failure for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease recurrence remain poorly understood. Here, we showed that 18S rRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A1832) modification and its methyltransferase complex METTL5/TRMT112 were upregulated in HCC and correlated with poor prognosis. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays demonstrated that METTL5/TRMT112 mediated 18S rRNA m6A1832 modification promotes HCC tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, 18S rRNA m6A1832 modification selectively regulated the translation of mRNAs with long 5'UTR and short 3'UTR through affecting the assembly of 80S subunit at translation initiation and its dissociation at translation termination which was executed by weakening the interaction of ABCE1 with eRF1 and eRF3. Moreover, METTL5-mediated 18S rRNA m6A1832 modification regulated ß-oxidation of long-chain fatty acid through ACSL4 to promote HCC progression. Our work uncovered a novel layer of mRNA translation regulation mechanism at ribosome 80S subunit assembly and dissociation step mediated by 18S rRNA m6A1832 modification and revealed a new crosslink between RNA epigenetic modification and fatty acid metabolism in HCC. Overall design: Ribo-seq was used to study the differential translated genes in the METTL5 knockout and control cells."
PRJNA732783,Integrative genome-wide analysis of dopaminergic neuron-specific PARIS expression dissects recognition of multiple PPAR-γ associated gene regulation (TRAP-Seq).,"PURPOSE: The transcriptional repressor PARIS (ZNF746) was initially identified as a pathogenic co-substrate of PINK1 and parkin that leads to Parkinson's disease (PD) by disrupting mitochondrial biogenesis through PPAR? coactivator -1a (PGC-1a) suppression. Later, accumulation of PARIS in dopamine (DA) neurons that cause neurotoxicity has been studied widely and growing evidence has linked defective mitochondrial biogenesis to PD pathogenesis. Yet, the mechanistic underpinnings of this link remain elusive. METHODS: We employed translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) followed by RNA sequencing (TRAP-seq) for transcriptome profiling of DA neurons in transgenic Drosophila lines we generated expressing human PARIS or human PARIS mutant (C571A). Together with TRAP control and whole brain samples, this data set is composed of a total of 10 (3, 3, 3, and 1 respectively) replicate samples representing 4 different treatment groups for a set of gene-level (a parametric F-test) and transcript-level (a Wald test or a likelihood ratio test) differential expression analysis. RESULTS: Firstly, we identified differentially expressed genes by human PARIS in fly DA neurons successfully. Then, we showed that PPAR? acts as a master regulator of transcriptomic changes induced by PARIS in the clusters of Drosophila dopaminergic neurons. Also, we validated this finding in human neuroblastoma cell line. CONCLUSION: PPAR? plays a crucial regulatory role in PARIS phenotype. Drosophila models of PARIS-induced neurodegeneration used in this work to represent PD phenotype and our TRAP-seq protocol serve as a paradigm for future studies to unravel mechanistic underpinnings of PARIS biology. Overall design: TRAP control (3X), PARIS wild type (3X), PARIS mutant (C571A) (3X), and whole brain (1X) samples, adding up to a total of 10 replicate samples representing 4 different groups. Whole brain serves as a control for TRAP enrichment. TRAP control serves as a control for PARIS transgenic constructs."
PRJNA732080,Intergenerational hormesis is regulated by heritable 18S rRNA methylation  18S rRNA methylation is heritably transmitted to regulate intergenerational hormesis,"Heritable non-genetic information can regulate a variety of complex phenotypes. However, what specific non-genetic cues are transmitted from parents to their descendants are unknown. Here, we perform metabolic methyl-labelling experiments to track the heritable transmission of methylation from ancestors to their descendants in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that methylation is transmitted to descendants in proteins, RNA, DNA and lipids. We further find that in response to parental starvation, naïve progeny display reduced fertility, increased heat stress resistance, and extended longevity. This intergenerational hormesis is accompanied by a heritable increase in N6'-dimethyl adenosine (m6,2A) on the 18S ribosomal RNA at adenosines 1735 and 1736. We identified DIMT-1 as the m6,2A methyltransferase in C. elegans and find that dimt-1 is required for the intergenerational hormesis phenotypes. Together this study provides the first labeling and tracking of heritable non-genetic material across generations and demonstrates the importance of rRNA methylation for regulating the heritable response to starvation Overall design: Matched mRNAseq and Ribo-seq (ribosome profiling). Two experiments: Fed vs. Starved (6 replicates each); Empty vector vs two targeted knockdowns (4 replicates each)"
PRJNA731488,eIF2B-capturing viral protein NSs suppresses the integrated stress response,"Various stressors such as viral infection lead to the suppression of cap-dependent translation and the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), since the stress-induced phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 [eIF2(aP)] tightly binds to eIF2B to prevent it from exchanging guanine nucleotide molecules on its substrate, unphosphorylated eIF2. Sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) evades this cap-dependent translation suppression through the interaction between its nonstructural protein NSs and host eIF2B. However, its precise mechanism has remained unclear. Here, our cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis revealed that SFSV NSs binds to the a-subunit of eIF2B in a competitive manner with eIF2(aP). Together with SFSV NSs, eIF2B retains nucleotide exchange activity even in the presence of eIF2(aP), in line with the cryo-EM structures of the eIF2B•SFSV NSs•unphosphorylated eIF2 complex. A genome-wide ribosome profiling analysis clarified that SFSV NSs expressed in cultured human cells attenuates the ISR triggered by thapsigargin, an endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer. Furthermore, SFSV NSs introduced in rat hippocampal neurons and human induced-pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived motor neurons exhibited neuroprotective effects against the ISR-inducing stress. Since ISR inhibition is beneficial in various neurological disease models, SFSV NSs is promising as a therapeutic ISR inhibitor. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq of SFSV NSs-expressing cells upon endoplasmic reticulum stress"
PRJNA731473,Phospho-RNA sequencing with CircAID-p-seq,"Accurate positional information concerning ribosomes and RNA binding proteins with respect to their transcripts is important to understand the global regulatory network underlying protein and RNA fate in living cells. Most footprinting approaches generate RNA fragments bearing a phosphate or cyclic phosphate groups at their 3' end. Unfortunately, all current protocols for library preparation rely only on the presence of a 3' hydroxyl group. Here, we developed circAID-p-seq, a PCR-free library preparation for 3' phospho-RNA sequencing. We applied circAID-p-seq to ribosome profiling, which produces fragments protected by ribosomes after endonuclease digestion. CircAID-p-seq, combined with the dedicated computational pipeline circAidMe, facilitates accurate, fast, highly efficient and low-cost sequencing of phospho-RNA fragments from eukaryotic cells and tissues. While assessing circAID-p-seq to portray ribosomes engaged with transcripts, we provide a versatile tool to unravel any 3'-phospho RNA molecules. Overall design: we design and validate a new library preparation for sequencing of 3'P or 2'/3' cP smallRNA fragments, using Oxford Nanopore platform"

Overall design: Mouse insulinoma cell MIN6 treated with 200uM of Cyclopiazonic acid for 1 (CPA1) and 18 hours (CPA18). An 18 hour DMSO treatment served as the control (CPA0). Ribo-seq and poly(A) enriched RNA-seq (mRNA-seq) have been proformed. Three independent biological replications were proformed.

Samples were harvested at 5 and 8 hpi by flash-freezing, without cycloheximide pre-treatment. RNase I treatment was carried out, following which ribosomes and enclosed RNA were isolated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. RNA was extracted, ribosomal RNA was removed using Illumina's RiboZero kit, and remaining RNA was gel purified to select fragments 25-35nt long. Fragments were cloned into adapters using the TruSeq small RNA adapter kit and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq, then differential translation efficiency analysis was carried out on the data deposited data. One uninfected sample was treated with 2ug/mL tunicamycin for 6 hours before harvesting as a positive control for unfolded protein response activation."
PRJNA729871,Dicer2 dependent transcriptional and translational regulation in Fusarium graminearum,"Information on the role of Fgdicer2-dependent miRNA on transcriptional and translational gene expression in plant pathogenic fungi is very limited. To further investigate the role of Fgdicer2 in miRNA biogenesis, and how the dicer2-dependent miRNAs regulate gene expression at transcriptional and translational level, we created a Fgdicer2 mutant and performed ribo-seq of Fgdicer2 and wildtype Fg grown in culture. This analysis revealed that there were no changes in the overall distribution of transcriptional gene expression in these genotypes . In contrast, the overall distribution of gene expression at both translational levels and TEs were increased in the Fgdicer2 mutant compared to wildtype Fg. This could be due to the loss of Fgdicer2-dependent miRNA-repression."

PRJNA729812,Transnational landscape in Fusarium graminearum during wheat infection,"To date, translational regulation of key genes controlling infection-related processes in fungal pathogens during their interactions with plants has not been studied. Here, we employed ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) to study translational responses and how such responses are coordinated with transcriptional changes in the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum (Fg), which causes Fusarium head blight (FHB), a destructive disease of cereal crops worldwide. This has revealed that transcription and translation were not always coordinated with approximately 22% of Fg genes showing a discordant relationship during wheat infection. Nitrite reductase, which we show here as an important component of fungal virulence, is only regulated at the translational level in Fg. In addition, more than 1000 new open reading frames (ORFs), many of which are short and highly conserved, were identified in the Fg genome. Like in higher eukaryotes, translation is controlled by upstream ORFs (uORFs) in Fg during infection. Similarly, miRNAs control both transcription and translation in Fg during wheat infection."
PRJNA729811,Transnational landscape in wheat against fusarium head blight disease,"The wheat genome has recently been sequenced and annotated. However, currently little, if any, is known about this genome at the translatome level. In this study, we used a ribo-seq strategy to perform global translatome analysis of wheat in response to Fusarium gramineaum. We describe the alternative translatome in wheat and the response of wheat to Fg infection at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Further, we found hundreds of novel unannotated ORFs, upstream and downstream ORFs and CDSs previously annotated as non-coding CDS in wheat genome annotation."
PRJNA729486,Single-cell dissection of the primary motor cortex in ALS and FTLD patients.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are two incurable and fatal neurodegenerative conditions. While distinct, they share many clinical, genetic, and pathological characteristics, and both show highly vulnerable layer 5 extratelencephalic-projecting cortical populations, including Betz cells in ALS2 and von Economo neurons (VENs) in FTLD.  Here, we report the first single-cell atlas of the human primary motor cortex and its changes in ALS and FTLD across ~380,000 nuclei from 64 control, sporadic and C9orf72-associated ALS and FTLD individuals. We identify 46 transcriptionally distinct cellular subtypes including two Betz-cell subtypes, and observe a previously-unappreciated molecular similarity between Betz cells and VENs of the frontal insula. Most dysregulated genes and pathways were shared, including stress response, ribosome function, oxidative phosphorylation, synaptic vesicle cycle, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, and autophagy. Betz cells and SCN4B+ long-range projecting L3/L5 cells are the most transcriptionally affected in both ALS and FTLD. Lastly, the VEN/Betz-cell-enriched dysregulated gene POU3F1 co-localizes with TDP-43 aggregates in Betz cells.

PRJNA729461,Combinatorial analyis of translation dynamics reveals eIF2 dependence of translation initiation at near-cognate codons,"Although ribosome-profiling and translation initiation sequencing (TI-seq) analyses have identified many noncanonical initiation codons, the precise detection of translation initiation sites (TISs) remains a challenge, mainly because of experimental artifacts of such analyses. Here we describe a new method, TISCA (TIS detection by translation Complex Analysis), for the accurate identification of TISs. TISCA proved to be more reliable for TIS detection compared with existing tools, and it identified a substantial number of near-cognate codons in Kozak-like sequence contexts. Analysis of proteomics data revealed the presence of methionine at the NH2-terminus of most proteins derived from near-cognate initiation codons. Although eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), eIF2A, and eIF2D have previously been shown to contribute to translation initiation at near-cognate codons, we found that most noncanonical initiation events are dependent on eIF2, consistent with the initial amino acid being methionine. Comprehensive identification of TISs by TISCA should facilitate characterization of the mechanism of noncanonical initiation. Overall design: TISCA (TIS detection by translation Complex Analysis), for the accurate identification of TISs"

PRJDB9689,microRNA-mediated ribosome stalling promotes secondary siRNA biogenesis in plants,"Ribosome traverse on mRNAs is not always smooth but can be impeded by various obstacles. One such example is halting of ribosome movements by microRNAs in plants. However, its exact mechanism and physiological role remain unclear. Here, by combining genome-wide ribosome profiling, in vitro biochemical analyses, and in planta assays, we found a direct link between microRNA-mediated ribosome stalling and amplification of RNA silencing. To stall ribosomes, the microRNA within Argonaute protein needs to directly interact with the double-stranded RNA-binding protein SGS3. Strikingly, ribosome stalling by microRNAs elicits the production of secondary small interfering RNAs from target mRNAs. Our results uncover a previously uncharacterized role for paused ribosomes."
PRJNA727323,Intergenic ORFs as elementary structural modules of de novo gene birth and protein evolution  ,"The noncoding genome plays an important role in de novo gene birth and the emergence of genetic novelty. Nevertheless, how the properties of noncoding sequences could promote the birth of novel genes and shape the structural diversity and evolution of proteins remains unclear. Here, we investigated the potential of the noncoding genome of yeast to produce novel protein bricks that can give rise to novel genes or be integrated in pre-existing proteins, thus participating in protein structure evolution and diversity. Combining different bioinformatics approaches, we showed that intergenic ORFs of yeast encompass the large structural diversity of canonical proteins with the majority encoding peptides predicted as foldable. Then, we investigated the early stages of de novo gene birth with Ribosome Profiling and systematic reconstruction of yeast de novo gene ancestral sequences. We highlighted sequence and structural factors determining de novo gene birth and protein evolution. Finally, we showed a strong correlation between the fold potential of de novo genes and their ancestral ORFs reflecting the relationship between the noncoding genome and the protein structure universe. Overall design: RiboSeq of two replicates of the same BY 4742 yeast  strain, to identify for alternative CDS in unanotated regions, such CDS are then called IGORFs if RiboSeq signal is detected."
PRJNA727314,RiboDoc: a Docker-based package for ribosome profiling analysis,"Ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) has emerged as a powerful technique for studying the genome-wide regulation of translation in various cells. Several steps in the biological protocol have been improved, but the bioinformatics part of RiboSeq suffers from a lack of standardization, preventing the straightforward and complete reproduction of published results. Too many published studies provide insufficient detail about the bioinformatics pipeline used. The broad range of questions that can be asked with RiboSeq makes it difficult to use a single bioinformatics tool. Indeed, many scripts have been published for addressing diverse questions. Here, we propose a unique tool (for use with multiple operating systems, OS) to standardize the general steps that must be performed systematically in RiboSeq analysis, together with the statistical analysis and quality control of the sample. The data generated can then be exploited with more specific tools. We hope that this tool will help to standardize bioinformatics analyses pipelines in the field of translation.

PRJNA727298,A role for the ribosome-associated complex in activation of the IRE1 branch of UPR,"The ubiquitous ribosome-associated complex (RAC) is a chaperone that spans ribosomes, making contacts near both the polypeptide exit tunnel and the decoding center, a position prime for sensing and coordinating translation and folding. Loss of RAC is known to result in growth defects and sensitization to translational and osmotic stresses. However, the physiological substrates of RAC and the mechanism(s) by which RAC is involved in responding to specific stresses in higher eukaryotes remain obscure. Data presented here uncover an essential function of mammalian RAC in the unfolded protein response (UPR). Knockdown of RAC sensitizes mammalian cells to ER stress and selectively interferes with IRE1 branch activation. Higher-order oligomerization of the IRE1a kinase/endoribonuclease depends upon RAC. These results reveal a surveillance function for RAC in the UPR: modulating IRE1a clustering as required for endonuclease activation and splicing of the substrate Xbp1 mRNA.

PRJNA725707,Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq of Rat whole brain,"Local translation in neurons is mediated in part by the reactivation of stalled polysomes. However, the mechanism for stalling of the polysomes is not understood. Stalled polysomes may be enriched in neuronal RNA granules defined by dense collections of compacted ribosomes found in the pellet of sucrose gradients used to separate polysomes from monosomes. We find that this fraction, isolated from P5 rat brains of both sexes, is enriched in proteins implicated in stalled polysome function, such as the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and Up-frameshift mutation 1 homolog (UPF1). Ribosome profiling of this fraction showed an abundance of footprint reads derived from mRNAs of cytoskeletal proteins implicated in neuronal development, as well as an enrichment of footprint reads on RNA binding proteins. The footprint reads were extended than those usually found in ribosome profiling studies on the 3'end and were found in reproducible peaks in the mRNAs with a bias towards the first half of the message. These footprint reads were enriched in motifs previously associated with mRNAs cross-linked to FMRP in vivo, independently linking the ribosomes in the sedimented pellet to the ribosomes associated with FMRP in the cell. The data supports a model in which specific sequences in mRNAs act to stall translation elongation in neurons, attracting FMRP and beginning a process where stalled ribosomes are packaged and transported in RNA granules. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq samples of Rat whole brain. Treatment condition: Cycloheximide vs Vehicle;  salt vs vehicle"

We identified Nucleolin (Ncl) as the direct binding partner of 5'-tRFCys. To identify the molecular mechanism underlying 5'-tRFCys promotion of breast cancer, we performed Ncl HITS-CLIP, RNA-Seq, Ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) upon inhibition of 5'-tRFCys. These analyses reveal that 5'-tRFCys enhances Ncl binding to a subset of transcripts, resulting in increased transcript stability of those transcripts and expression. Overall design: To identify tRNA fragments (tRFs) that regulate metastasis, tRFs were profiled from non-metastatic 67NR, poorly-metastatic 4TO7 or highly-metastatic 4T1 breast cancer cells using small RNA-Seq (sRNA-Seq). To identify the direct targets of 5'-tRFCys, Ncl HITS-CLIP was performed upon 5'-tRFCys suppression.

PRJNA725118,The human mitochondrial translatome promotes mitonuclear balance,"Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes consist of nuclear- and mitochondrial- encoded subunits, forcing cross-compartment synchronization of gene expression to achieve mitonuclear balance. To characterize how human cells coordinate OXPHOS gene expression, we establish a mitoribosome profiling approach that resolves features of the mitochondrial translatome, including the synthesis of a four amino acid mitopeptide. Strikingly, average mitochondrial and cytoplasmic synthesis rates correspond precisely across OXPHOS complexes. Coordinated mitochondrial and cytosolic synthesis does not require rapid feedback between the two translation systems. By contrast, we find that the Leigh syndrome gene, LRPPRC, maintains correlated mitochondrial and cytosolic translatomes. Our results lead to a model of human mitonuclear balance that requires tightly balanced cross-compartment protein synthesis, representing a vulnerability for cellular proteostasis. Overall design: Mitochondrial ribosome profiling in 5 human cells types, as well as cytosolic ribosome profiling and RNA-seq in select cell types. Drug and genetic perturbations also included"
PRJNA723762,"Combinatorial optimization of mRNA structure, stability, and translation for RNA-based therapeutics","Therapeutic mRNAs and vaccines are being developed for a broad range of human diseases, including COVID-19. However, their optimization is hindered by mRNA instability and inefficient protein expression. Here, we describe design principles that overcome these barriers. We develop a new RNA sequencing-based platform called PERSIST-seq to systematically delineate in-cell mRNA stability, ribosome load, as well as in-solution stability of a library of diverse mRNAs. We find that, surprisingly, in-cell stability is a greater driver of protein output than high ribosome load. We further introduce a method called In-line-seq, applied to thousands of diverse RNAs, that reveals sequence and structure-based rules for mitigating hydrolytic degradation. Our findings show that “superfolder” mRNAs can be designed to improve both stability and expression that are further enhanced through pseudouridine nucleoside modification. Together, our study demonstrates simultaneous improvement of mRNA stability and protein expression and provides a computational-experimental platform for the enhancement of mRNA medicines. Overall design: For polysome profiling experiments, 16 polysome fractions were collected and sequenced. For RNA degradation experiments in cells, 5 timepoints with 3 replicates each were collected.

PRJNA722238,Aberrant translation regulation by METTL1/WDR4-mediated tRNA N7-methylguanosine modification drives HNSCC progression,"The cancer cells selectively promote the translation of specific oncogenic transcripts to stimulate cancer progression. Although growing evidence has revealed that tRNA modifications and related genes participate in this process, their roles in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remain largely uncharacterized. Here we found that tRNA m7G methyltransferase complex components METTL1/WDR4 were both upregulated in HNSCC and associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, METTL1/WDR4 promoted HNSCC progression and metastasis in cell-based and transgenic mouse models. Mechanistically, ablation of METTL1 reduced m7G levels of 16 tRNAs, causing translational inhibition of a subset of oncogenic transcripts, including the genes related to PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, chemical modulators of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway can reverse the effects of Mettl1 in HNSCC. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing results revealed that depletion of Mettl1 in tumor cells altered the immune landscape and cell-cell interaction between tumor and stromal compartment. In summary, this study uncovered the physiological function and mechanism of mis-translation regulation mediated by tRNA m7G modification in HNSCC, and suggested that targeting METTL1 could be a promising treatment strategy for HNSCC patients. Overall design: TRAC-Seq were developed to identify the tRNA m7G methylome in HNSCC cell line.  Polyribosome-bound-RNA-seq  was used to study the differentially translated genes in the METTL1 knockout and control cells. Ribo-seq was performed to study the differentially translated genes and ribosome processivity in the METTL1 knockout and control cells. scRNA-seq of murine HNSCC from 4NQO-induced Mettl1cKO and wild type transgenic mice."
PRJDB11308,A combined analysis of translation dynamics reveals eIF2 dependence of translation initiation at near-cognate codons,"Although ribosome profiling and translation initiation sequencing (TI-seq) analyses identifies a large number of non-canonical initiation codons, precise detection of translation initiation sites (TIS) remains a challenge, mainly due to the experimental artifacts of those analyses. Here we develop a method termed TISCA (TIS detection by translation Complex Analysis) for accurate identification of the TISs. TISCA shows higher reliability for TIS detection than other existing tools, and identify a significant number of near-cognate codons adjacent to Kozak-like sequence contexts. Proteomics analysis reveals that the majority of the NH2-terminus of proteins derived from the near-cognate initiation codons is methionine. Although eIF2, eIF2A, and eIF2D are known to contribute to translation initiation at near-cognate codons, most non-canonical initiation events are eIF2-dependent, consistent with the initial amino acid being methionine. The comprehensive identification of TISs facilitates the analysis of non-canonical initiation mechanisms."
PRJNA720951,HMGB1 coordinates SASP-related chromatin folding and RNA homeostasis on the path to senescence [Ribo-seq],"Spatial organization and gene expression of mammalian chromosomes are maintained and regulated in conjunction with cell cycle progression. This is perturbed once cells enter senescence and the highly abundant HMGB1 protein is depleted from nuclei to act as an extracellular proinflammatory stimulus. Despite its physiological importance, we know little about the positioning of HMGB1 on chromatin and its nuclear roles. To address this, we mapped HMGB1 binding genome-wide in two primary cell lines. We integrated ChIP-seq and Hi-C with graph theory to uncover clustering of HMGB1-marked topological domains that harbour genes required for paracrine senescence. Using sCLIP and functional tests, we show that HMGB1 is also a bona fide RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding hundreds of mRNAs. It presents an interactome rich in RBPs implicated in senescence regulation. The mRNAs of many of these RBPs are directly bound by HMGB1 and regulate the availability of SASP-relevant transcripts. Our findings highlight a broader than hitherto assumed role for HMGB1 in coordinating chromatin folding and RNA homeostasis as part of a regulatory loop controlling cell-autonomous and paracrine senescence. Overall design: Single IMR90 isolates (I90-10 and -79, passage 5; Coriell Biorepository) were continuously passaged to replicative exhaustion. Three independent replicas of proliferating or senescent IMR90 were used."
PRJNA720892,nRibo-Seq timecourse in mESCs,"mRNAs are generally assumed to be loaded instantly with ribosomes upon entry into the cytoplasm. To measure ribosome density on nascent mRNA, we developed nascent Ribo-Seq (nRibo-Seq) by combining Ribo-Seq with progressive 4-thiouridine labelling. In mouse macrophages, we experimentally determined, for the first time, the lag between the appearance of nascent RNA and its association with ribosomes, which was calculated to be 20 - 22 min for bulk mRNA, and approximated the time it takes for mRNAs to be fully loaded with ribosomes to be 41 - 44 min. Notably, ribosomal loading time is adapted to gene function as rapid loading was observed with highly regulated genes. The lag and ribosomal loading time correlate positively with ORF size and half-life, and negatively with tRNA adaptation indices. Similar results were obtained in mESCs, where the lag between IN and FP was even more pronounced with 35 - 38 min. We validated our measurements after stimulation of macrophages with lipopolysaccharide, where the lag between cytoplasmic and translated mRNA leads to a corresponding uncoupling between input and ribosome-protected fragments. Uncoupling is stronger for mRNAs with long ORFs or half-lives, a finding we also confirmed at the level of protein production by nascent chain proteomics. As a consequence of the lag in ribosome loading, ribosome density measurements are distorted when performed under conditions where mRNA levels are far from steady state expression, and transcriptional changes affect ribosome density in a passive way. This study uncovers an unexpected and considerable lag in ribosome loading, and provides guidelines for the interpretation of Ribo-Seq data taking passive effects on ribosome density into account.

PRJNA717246,Profiling and functional characterization of maternal mRNA translation in mouse maternal-to-zygotic transition,"Translational regulation plays an important role in gene expression and function. Although the transcriptional dynamics of mouse pre-implantation embryos has been well characterized, the global mRNA translation landscape and the master regulators of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) remain unknown. Here, by developing and applying a low-input ribosome profiling (LiRibo-seq) technique, we profiled the mRNA translation landscape in mouse pre-implantation embryos and revealed the translational dynamics during mouse pre-implantation development. We identified a dramatic translational transition from MII oocytes to zygotes, and demonstrated that active translation of maternal mRNAs is essential for maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). We further showed that two maternal factors, Smarcd2 and Cyclin T2, whose translation is activated in zygotes, are required for chromatin reprogramming and ZGA, respectively. Our study thus not only filled in a knowledge gap on translational regulation during mammalian pre-implantation development, but also revealed new insights into the critical function of maternal mRNA translation in MZT. Overall design: In this study, we modified RiboLace sequencing method to achieve mRNA translation profiling using as few as 100-250 oocytes or embryos. Using this low-input ribosome sequencing (LiRibo-seq) method, we have generated mRNA translation profiling of mouse MII oocytes and preimplantation embryos from 1-cell to blastocyst stage, revealing the dynamics of mRNA translation during the natural developmental process. We constructed a total of 14 LiRibo-seq datasets, including: two 5k ESC libraries, two MII oocyte libraries, two 1-cell embryo libraries, two 2-cell embryo libraries, two 4-cell embryo libraries, two morula libraries, two blastocyst embryo libraries. 12 total RNA-seq datasets were generated including two MII oocyte libraries, two 1-cell embryo libraries, two 2-cell embryo libraries, two 4-cell embryo libraries, two morula libraries, two blastocyst embryo libraries. 16 polyA RNA-seq datasets were generated including two MII oocyte libraries, two 1-cell embryo libraries, two DMSO and CHX treated zygote libraries, two DMSO and AMA treated zygote libraries, two siRNA control and Ccnt2 KD 2-cell embryo libraries. 8 ATAC-seq datasets were generated including two DMSO and CHX zygotes libraries, two siRNA control and Smarcd2 KD 1-cell embryo libraries."
PRJNA717063,N7-methylguanosine tRNA modification promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tumorigenesis via the RPTOR/ULK1/autophagy axis,"The cancer cells selectively promote the translation of oncogenic mRNAs to facilitate cancer progression, while the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The tRNA N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification is not essential for yeast growth, but in mammals mis-regulations of tRNA m7G modification cause stem cell defect and developmental disorders. Here we found that tRNA m7G methyltransferase complex components METTL1 and WDR4 are elevated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues and associated with poor ESCC prognosis. Functionally, depletion of METTL1 or WDR4 suppresses proliferation, migration, and invasion of ESCC cells. In addition, forced expression of METTL1 or WDR4 promotes ESCC progression depending on the tRNA m7G methyltransferase activity. Mechanistically, METTL1 knockdown leads to reduced tRNA m7G modification and decreased expression of m7G-modified tRNAs. Depletion of METTL1 selectively reduces the translation of a subset of oncogenic transcripts, including the genes related to mTOR signaling and autophagy in m7G related codon dependent manner. Rescue assays revealed the essential function of RPTOR/ULK1/autophagy axis in METTL1 driven ESCC progression. Furthermore, ESCC initiation and progression models using Mettl1 conditional knockout and knockin mice uncovered the strong physiological function of Mettl1 in promoting in vivo ESCC tumorigenesis. Our study uncovered a new layer of translation regulation mechanism mediated by tRNA m7G modification, provided strong evidence to support the important physiological function of mis-regulated tRNA modification in cancer, and suggested that targeting METTL1 and its downstream signaling axis could be a promising strategy for ESCC treatment. Overall design: TRAC-Seq were developed to identify the tRNA m7G methylome in ESCC cell line. Polyribosome-bound-RNA-seq was used to study the differentially translated genes in the METTL1 knockdown and control cells. Ribo-seq was performed to study the differentially translated genes and ribosome processivity in the METTL1 knockdown and control cells.

PRJNA715464,Ribosome profiling RNA sequencing in zebrafish embryos,"We show that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)-mediated zebrafish Ddx3xb condensation facilitates MZT through promoting maternal mRNAs translation. Ddx3xb forms condensates via its N-terminal intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), and the gradually increased ATP concentration after fertilization promotes its aggregation capability. Ddx3xb-deficiency decelerates the decay of maternal mRNAs and impedes zygotic genome activation, further leading to developmental defect. The phenotype in Ddx3xb-deficiency embryos can be efficiently rescued by condensed Ddx3xb, but not the Ddx3xb without LLPS ability. Mechanistically, the condensation of Ddx3xb is vital for its RNA helicase activity, which is critical for involved in promoting translation efficiency of maternal mRNAs through opening 5' UTR structures during the MZT process. Our study demonstrates that the condensation of Ddx3xb promotes maternal mRNAs translation via its RNA unwinding activity and further facilitates MZT, highlighting the critical role of protein phase separation in translational control and animal early development.    Overall design: Ribo-seq of 2 samples from Ddx3xb mutant zebrafish embryos at 4 hpf, 2 samples from Ddx3xb mutant injected with ddx3xbFL zebrafish embryos at 4 hpf and  2 samples from Ddx3xb mutant injected with ddx3xb_deltaN zebrafish embryos at 4 hpf Please note that each processed data was generated from both replicates and is linked to the corresponding rep1 sample records."

PRJNA714824,Phosphorylation of Ribosomal Protein S6 differentially affects mRNA translation based on ORF length,"Phosphorylation of Ribosomal Protein S6 (RPS6) was the first post-translational modification of the ribosome to be identified and is a commonly-used readout for mTORC1 activity. Although the cellular and organismal functions of RPS6 phosphorylation are known, its molecular consequences on translation are less well understood. Here we use selective ribosome footprinting to analyze the location of ribosomes containing phosphorylated RPS6 on endogenous mRNAs in cells. We find that RPS6 becomes progressively dephosphorylated on ribosomes as they translate an mRNA. As a consequence, average RPS6 phosphorylation is higher on mRNAs with short coding sequences (CDSs) compared to mRNAs with long CDSs. Loss of RPS6 phosphorylation causes a correspondingly larger drop in translation efficiency of mRNAs with short CDSs than long CDSs. Interestingly, mRNAs with 5' TOP motifs are translated well also in the absence of RPS6 phosphorylation despite short CDS lengths, suggesting they are translated via a different mode. In sum this provides a dynamic view of RPS6 phosphorylation on ribosomes as they translate mRNAs and the functional consequence on translation. Overall design: We develop modification selective ribosome footprinting to determine the rate of RPS6 phosphorylation of translating ribosomes across the translatome. This allows us to gain mechanistic understanding of the role of RPS6 phosphorylation in ribosome function."
PRJNA714407,Sequencing of RNA and footprints of wildtype and RpS5b mutant Drosophila ovaries [RIBO-seq],"Emerging evidence suggests that ribosome heterogeneity may have important functional consequences in the translation of specific mRNAs within different cell types and under various conditions. Ribosome heterogeneity comes in many forms including post-translational modification of ribosome proteins (RPs), lack of specific RPs, and different RP paralogs incorporation. The Drosophila genome encodes for two RPS5 paralogs, RpS5a and RpS5b. While RpS5a is expressed ubiquitously, RpS5b exhibits enriched expression in the reproductive system. Deletion of RpS5b results in female sterility marked by developmental arrest of egg chambers at stages 7-8 and posterior follicle cell (PFC) hyperplasia. Both phenotypes are caused by defects in the germline and over-expression of RpS5a can compensate it. RpS5b mutant display increased rRNA transcription and RP production, accompanied by increased protein synthesis. Loss of RpS5b leads to microtubule-based defects and mislocalization of several factors, leading failure of Notch pathway activation in PFCs. Together, our results indicate that germ cell specific expression of RpS5b promotes proper egg chamber development by regulating both ribosome homeostasis and protein trafficking during mid-oogenesis. Overall design: RNA-seq and footprint-seq experiment to compare gene expression as well as ribosome distribution between wildtype and the mutant ovaries."

The eIF2a phosphorylation blocks the ternary complex formation and therefore inhibits translation initiation. Meanwhile, GCN2 activation associates with ribosomes and some translation elongation factors such as eEF1A. In Neurospora crassa, the homolog of GCN2 is CPC-3. Ribosome profiling and accompanying RNA-seq experiments in this project were used to explore the effects of CPC-3 on translation kinetics. Here we show that poor codon usage of mRNAs with long CDS preferentially causes CPC-3 activation, which in turn suppresses the translation initiation and elongation in both codon usage and CDS length dependent manner.

PRJNA707537,A Rapid Translational Immune Response Program in CD8 Memory T Lymphocytes,"Abstract: Immune cell activation is a very rapid and concerted cellular response that requires coordination between cellular processes that occur in different compartments and on very different time scales. Here, we use ribosome profiling and deep RNA sequencing to define the acute mRNA translation changes that follow initial signaling events and enable subsequent events of T cell activation and expansion.  Briefly, early events in the activation of antigen experienced CD 8 T cells are insensitive to transcriptional blockade with actinomycin, and instead depend on the translation of pre-existing mRNAs and blocked by cycloheximide. Ribosome profiling identifies ~92 mRNAs that are recruited into ribosomes following CD8 T cell stimulation. These mRNAs typically have structured GC and pyrimidine rich 5'UTRs and they encode key regulators of T cell activation and proliferation such as Notch1, Ifngr1, Il2rb, serine metabolism enzymes Psat1 and Shmt2, and translation factors eEF1a1 and eEF2. The increased production of receptors of IL2 and IFN? precedes the activation of gene expression and augments cellular signals and T cell activation. Together, we identify the early RNA translation program that acts in a feed-forward manner to enable the rapid and dramatic process of CD8 T cell expansion and activation.

PRJNA705358,One-shot analysis of translated mammalian lncRNAs with AHARIBO,"A vast portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) acting in the cytoplasm with largely unknown functions. Surprisingly, lncRNAs have been shown to interact with ribosomes, encode uncharacterized proteins, or act as ribosome sponges. These functions still remain mostly undetected and understudied owing to the lack of efficient tools for genome-wide simultaneous identification of ribosome-associated lncRNAs and peptide-producing lncRNAs. Here we present AHARIBO, a method for the detection of lncRNAs either untranslated, but associated with ribosomes, or encoding small peptides. Using AHARIBO in mouse embryonic stem cells during neuronal differentiation, we isolated ribosome-protected RNA fragments, translated RNAs and corresponding de novo synthesized polypeptides. Besides identifying mRNAs under active translation and associated ribosomes, we found and distinguished lncRNAs acting as ribosome sponges or encoding micropeptides, laying the ground for a better functional understanding of hundreds lncRNAs. Overall design: We performed standard and AHARIBO (AHA-mediated RIBOsome isolation) RIBO-Seq on mouse embryonic stem cells. AHARIBO RIBO-Seq is based on the isolation of ribosomes trapped with their nascent peptides, by incorporating the non-canonical amino acid L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) followed by ribosome profiling.

PRJNA704763,Ribosome-profiling reveals restricted translation of antiviral cytokines and transcription factors during SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in over 2.2 million deaths. Disease outcomes range from asymptomatic to severe with, so far, minimal genotypic change to the virus. Understanding host factors driving severity is paramount. Transcriptomics has become incredibly important in understanding host-pathogen interactions; however, post-transcriptional regulation plays an important role in infection and immunity through translation and mRNA stability, allowing tight control over potent host responses by both the host and the invading virus. Here we apply ribosome profiling to assess post-transcriptional regulation of host genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3). We have identified numerous transcription factors and select antiviral cytokine genes, namely IFNB1, IFNL1,2 and 3, IL-6 and CCL5, that are restricted at the post-transcriptional level. This early phase restriction of antiviral transcripts the lungs may contribute to higher viral loads and consequent immune dysregulation, typically seen in SARS-CoV-2 infection."
PRJNA704712,"Innate, translation-dependent silencing of an invasive transposon in Arabidopsis","Co-evolution between hosts' and parasites' genomes shapes diverse pathways of acquired immunity based on silencing small (s)RNAs. In plants, sRNAs cause heterochromatinization, sequence-degeneration and, ultimately, loss-of-autonomy of most transposable elements (TEs). Recognition of newly-invasive plant TEs, by contrast, involves an innate antiviral-like silencing response. To investigate this response's activation, we studied the single-copy element EVADÉ (EVD), one of few representatives of the large Ty1/Copia family able to proliferate in Arabidopsis when epigenetically-reactivated. In Ty1/Copia-elements, a short subgenomic mRNA (shGAG) provides the necessary excess of structural GAG protein over the catalytic components encoded by the full-length genomic flGAG-POL. We show here that the predominant cytosolic distribution of shGAG strongly favors its translation over mostly-nuclear flGAG-POL. During this process, an unusually intense ribosomal stalling event coincides with mRNA breakage yielding unconventional 5'OH RNA fragments that evade RNA-quality-control. The starting-point of sRNA production by RNA-DEPENDENT-RNA-POLYMERASE-6 (RDR6), exclusively on shGAG, occurs precisely at this breakage point. This hitherto-unrecognized translation-dependent silencing (TdS) is independent of codon-usage or GC-content and is not observed on TE remnants populating the Arabidopsis genome, consistent with their poor association, if any, with polysomes. We propose that TdS forms a primal defense against EVD de novo invasions that underlies its associated sRNA pattern. Overall design: Ribo-seq and sRNA-seq were performed on RNA from inflorescence tissue of EVD and GFP-EVD-GUS overexpressing plants. NanoPare and SMART-seq2 was perfomed on wild-type (Col-0) and ddm1-2 inflorescence tissue."

PRJNA704627,Structural basis of ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is the key event during translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome allowing synthesis of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and downstream viral proteins. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the mammalian ribosome in the process of translating viral RNA paused in a conformation primed for frameshifting. We observe that the viral RNA adopts a pseudoknot structure lodged at the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome to generate tension in the mRNA that leads to frameshifting. The nascent viral polyprotein that is being synthesized by the ribosome paused at the frameshifting site forms distinct interactions with the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel. We use biochemical experiments to validate our structural observations and to reveal mechanistic and regulatory features that influence the frameshifting efficiency. Finally, a compound previously shown to reduce frameshifting is able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected cells, establishing coronavirus frameshifting as target for antiviral intervention. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro translation"
PRJNA704316,Analysis of the eIF4E3-dependent translatome after Torin1-induced stress in N2a cells ctrl and eIF4E3 KO,"The eIF4E are a family of initiation factors that bind the mRNA 5' cap, regulating the proteome and the cellular phenotype. eIF4E1 mediates global translation and its activity is controlled via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. mTOR down-regulation results in eIF4E1 sequestration into an inactive complex with the 4E binding proteins (4EBPs). The second member, eIF4E2, regulates the translatome during hypoxia. However, the exact function of the third member, eIF4E3, has remained elusive. We have dissected its function using a range of techniques. Starting from the observation that it does not interact with 4EBP1, we demonstrate that eIF4E3 recruitment into an eIF4F complex occurs when Torin1 inhibits the mTOR pathway. Ribo-seq studies demonstrate that this complex (eIF4FS) is translationally active only during stress and that it selects specific mRNA populations based on 5' TL (UTR) length. The interactome reveals that it associates with cellular proteins beyond the cognate initiation factors, suggesting that it may have “moon-lighting” functions. Finally, we provide evidence that cellular metabolism is altered in an eIF4E3 KO background but only upon Torin1 treatment. We propose that eIF4E3 acts as a second branch of the integrated stress response, re-programming the translatome to promote “stress resistance” and adaptation. Overall design: 3 biological replicates for each of the four conditions tested: N2a WT cells +/- Torin1, N2a KO cells +- Torin1"
PRJNA703979,A forward genetics screen identifies modifiers of Rocaglate responsiveness,"Rocaglates are a class of eukaryotic translation initiation inhibitors that are being explored as chemotherapeutic agents. They function by targeting eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A, an RNA helicase critical for recruitment of the 40S ribosome (and associated factors) to mRNA templates. To appreciate how rocaglates could best be enabled in the clinic, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is important, as this could inform on strategies to bypass such events as well as responsive tumor types. In performing a forward genetics screen using a cDNA library, we identified FOXP3 to be a gene of interest. As FOXP3 is a known transcriptional regulator, understandings its impacts on the transcriptional landscape was a logical undertaking in elucidating the resistance mechanis. Here, we report on the RNAseq results in Hap1 cells overexpressing FOXP3 compared to a negative control cell line expressing GFP. We find that certain genes involved in response to drug, such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), are potently upregulated in a FOXP3-overexpression setting. Overall design: We performed RNA-Seq transcriptional profiling of Hap1 cells overexpressing FOXP3 or GFP cDNAs. Briefly, Hap1 CML cells were transduced with vectors encoding our genes of interest. Each cell line (5 x 10^6) was then seeded into 10 cm dishes and allowed to expand for 48 hours. Cells were then washed with PBS, and RNA was harvested using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit with on-column DNase I digestion. Samples were then sent to the Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montréal (IRCM) for library preparation and deep sequencing. RNA integrity was first assessed on Bioanalyzer RNA Pico chips, then strand-specific, barcoded libraries were prepared via cDNA production, PCR, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion. Deep sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform with paired-end 50 reads at approximately 50 million reads per sample. Biological triplicates for both GFP- and FOXP3-expressing cells were obtained."

Overall design: EndoC-BH1 cells have been treated 24h with proinflammatory cytokines 1000 U/ml IFN? and 2 ng/ml IL1ß for 24 h. RNA was isolated by TRizol and sequenced by nanopore sequencing to etablish the de novo transcritpome.

PRJNA703841,Peroxisome import stress induces eIF2α phosphorylation and impairs ribosome biogenesis,"Peroxisome biogenesis diseases (PBDs) are characterized by global defects in peroxisomal function and can result in severe brain, liver, kidney, and bone malfunctions. PBDs are due to mutations in peroxisome biogenesis factors (PEX genes) that are responsible for peroxisome assembly and function. Increasing evidence suggests that peroxisome import functions decline during aging. However, the transcriptome profiling of peroxisome import defects and how they affect disease development are still lacking. PEX5 encodes the cytoplasmic receptors for peroxisome-targeting signal types 1. We generate knock-in human HEK293 cells mutant using CRISPR to transiently express PEX5 cysteine 11 to alanine mutant (PEX5C11A), which blocks PEX5 recycling and exerts dominant negative effect on PEX5 mediated peroxisome import. To identify conserved responses, we perform transcriptomic analysis on Drosophila oenocyte-specific Pex1, Pex12 and Pex5 knockdowns and on human cells with impaired peroxisome import (through expressing PEX5C11A and applying PEX5 siRNA respectively). PEX5C11A induction triggers vast transcriptomic changes, including decreased oxidative phosphorylation, increased MAPK signaling and HIPPO signaling. PEX5 siRNA specifically decreases spliceosome activity and increases cholesterol metabolism. Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we identify protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway, specifically ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway is induced in all PEX knockdowns in Drosophila. Peroxisome dysfunction elevates eIF2a phosphorylation in both Drosophila and human cell culture independent of XBP1 activation, suggesting increased integrative stress response (ISR). Moreover, peroxisome stress decreases ribosome biogenesis genes and impairs ribosome biogenesis in flies and human cells. Specifically, peroxisome stress impairs the 5'-ETS cleavage activity during the ribosome biogenesis and dampens 40S small ribosomal export in both flies and human. Our results suggest that reduced ribosome biogenesis and elevated ISR could be conserved cellular response to peroxisome import stress. Overall design: We analyzed Drosophila oenocyte-specific Pex1, Pex5 and Pex12 knockdown (PromE-Gal4 > RNAi) samples. RNAi is induced upon mifepristone feeding (+RU), thus, no RU feeding is included as control (-RU). We also included oenocyte control samples (PromE-Gal4 > wild type), treated with or without RU. We included human cell lines with inducible PEX5C11A mutant protein (treated with or without Doxycycline) and human cells treated with or without PEX5 siRNA. 3 replicates in each group and a total of 36 samples are analyzed."
PRJNA702531,"Reprogramming of translation in yeast cells impaired for ribosome recycling favors short, efficiently translated mRNAs","Yeast strains lacking orthologs of mammalian eIF2D (Tma64), and either MCT-1 (Tma20) or DENR (Tma22) are broadly impaired for 40S recycling; however, it was unknown whether this defect leads to reduced 43S PIC levels with an impact on translation of particular mRNAs. To test this, we by combined ribosome footprint profiling with RNA-seq analysis of mRNA abundance. Overall design: This study includes a total of 36 samples comprised of 18 RNA-seq samples (mRNA) and 18 ribosome footprint profiling samples (ribo). Experiment 1 includes 12 samples, comprised of 6 RNA-seq samples and 6 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from 2 biological replicates each of the BY4741 (WT1) and yeast tma64?/tma20? double mutant H4520 (tma??) which were grown at 30ºC in synthetic complete (SC) medium to log-phase (A600 = 0.5–0.6) and BY4741 grown in SC media lacking isoleucine and valine (SC-Ile/Val) to log-phase (A600 = 0.5–0.6) and treated with the antimetabolite Sulfometuron methyl (SM) at 1 µg/mL for 25 min to induce eIF2a phosphorylation. Experiment 2 examines the effect of the yeast homolog of eIF2D (Tma64) to promote translation initiation on the subset of mRNAs whose translation efficiencies (TEs) are reduced in the tma?? mutant by complementing the function of eIF2 in delivering Met-tRNAi to the 40S subunit. This experiment includes 8 samples, 4 RNA-seq samples and 4 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from 2 biological replicates each of WT2 and the tma64? mutant 4051, cultured in SC medium at 30ºC. Experiment 3 examines effect of depleting 40S subunit protein on translation efficiencies of strong and weak mRNA and includes 8 samples, 4 RNA-seq samples and 4 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from 2 biological replicates each of WT3 strain H2994 and the rps26?? mutant JVY09 were cultured in SC medium (SC medium with 2% galactose+2% raffinose) at 30ºC to log-phase were shifted from galactose- to glucose-containing media for 3h. Experiment 4 examines effect of the transcriptional changes evoked by Gcn4 induction responsible for the translational reprogramming produced by SM treatment of WT cells and includes 8 samples, 4 RNA-seq samples and 4 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from 2 biological replicates each of the gcn4? mutant 249, cultured in SC with or without SM treatment."

PRJNA702160,Ribosome profiling reveals sequence-independent post-initiation pausing as a signature of translation,"The journey of a newly synthesized polypeptide starts in the peptidyltransferase center of the ribosome, from where it traverses the exit tunnel. The interior of the ribosome exit tunnel is neither straight nor smooth. How the ribosome dynamics in vivo is influenced by the exit tunnel is poorly understood. Genome-wide ribosome profiling in mammalian cells reveals elevated ribosome density at the start codon and surprisingly the downstream 5th codon position as well. We found that the highly focused ribosomal pausing shortly after initiation is attributed to the geometry of the exit tunnel, as deletion of the loop region from ribosome protein L4 diminishes translational pausing at the 5th codon position. Unexpectedly, the ribosome variant undergoes translational abandonment shortly after initiation, suggesting that there exists an obligatory step between initiation and elongation commitment. We propose that the post-initiation pausing of ribosomes represents an inherent signature of the translation machinery to ensure productive translation. Overall design: We performed Ribo-seq in wildtype HEK293 cells and the cells expressed with mutated RPL4."
PRJNA701951,Ribo-Seq experiments in HCT116 WT and TP53-/- cells upon neocarzinostatin treatment,"The transcription factor p53 exerts its tumor suppressive effects through transcriptional activation of numerous target genes controlling cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cellular senescence and DNA repair. In addition, there is evidence that p53 influences the translation of specific mRNAs, including translational attenuation of ribosomal protein synthesis and translational activation of MDM2. A challenge in the analysis of translational control is that changes in mRNA abundance exert a kinetic (passive) effect on ribosome densities. In order to separate these passive effects from active regulation of translation efficiency in response to p53 activation, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of translational regulation by comparative analysis of mRNA levels and ribosome densities upon DNA damage induced by neocarzinostatin in wild-type and TP53-/- HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells. Thereby, we identified a specific group of mRNAs whose translation is actively up-regulated in response to p53 activation, the majority of which are transcribed from p53 target genes including MDM2, SESN1 and CDKN1A. By subsequent polysome profile analysis, we could demonstrate that a p53-dependent switch in transcript isoform expression is responsible for translational activation of SESN1, whereas translational activation of CDKN1A occurs through a trans-acting mechanism that affects multiple transcript isoforms. Overall design: RNaseI digested ribosome footprint of cytoplasmic mRNAs or monosome fraction after sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, or alkaline fragmentated total mRNA in HCT116 WT and TP53-/- cells upon neocarzinostatin treatment"

PRJNA701625,Mutant huntingtin stalls ribosomes and represses protein synthesis in a cellular model of Huntington disease (mRNA-Seq),"The polyglutamine expansion of huntingtin (mHtt) causes Huntington disease (HD) and neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that mHtt promotes ribosome stalling and suppresses protein synthesis. Depletion of mHtt enhances protein synthesis and increases the speed of ribosome translocation, while mHtt directly inhibits protein synthesis in vitro. We found interactions of ribosomal proteins and translating ribosomes with mHtt. High-resolution global ribosome footprint profiling (Ribo-Seq) and mRNA-Seq indicated a widespread shift in ribosome occupancy toward the 5' and 3' end and unique single-codon pauses on selected mRNA targets in HD cells, compared to controls. Thus, mHtt impedes ribosomal translocation during translation by promoting ribosome stalling, a novel mechanistic defect that can be exploited for HD therapeutics. Overall design: To identify the ribosome-bound messages associated with the stalled ribosomes in HD-homozygous cells in comparison with control, we conducted a harringtonine-based ribosome run-off (RR) assay followed by mRNA-Seq (PS-RRA-mRNASeq)."
PRJNA701262,The molecular basis of coupling between poly(A)-tail length and translational efficiency,"In animal oocytes and early embryos, mRNA poly(A)-tail length strongly influences translational efficiency (TE), but later in development this coupling between tail length and TE disappears. Here, we elucidate how this coupling is first established and why it disappears. Overexpressing cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) in frog oocytes specifically improved translation of short-tailed mRNAs, thereby diminishing coupling between tail length and TE. Thus, coupling requires limiting PABPC, implying that in coupled systems longer-tail mRNAs better compete for limiting PABPC. In addition to expressing excess PABPC, post-embryonic cells had two other properties that prevented strong coupling: terminal-uridylation-dependent destabilization of mRNAs lacking bound PABPC, and a regulatory regime wherein PABPC contributes minimally to TE. Thus, these results revealed three fundamental mechanistic requirements for coupling and defined the context-dependent functions for PABPC, in which this protein promotes TE but not mRNA stability in coupled systems and mRNA stability but not TE in uncoupled systems.

PRJNA699598,Cytoplasmic long non-coding RNAs are differentially regulated and translated during human neuronal differentiation,"The expression of long non-coding RNAs is highly enriched in the human nervous system. However, the function of neuronal lncRNAs in the cytoplasm and their potential translation remains poorly understood. Here we performed Poly-Ribo-Seq to understand the interaction of lncRNAs with the translation machinery and the functional consequences during neuronal differentiation of human SH-SH5Y cells. We discovered 237 cytoplasmic lncRNAs upregulated during early neuronal differentiation, 58-70% of which are associated with polysome translation complexes. Amongst these polysome associated lncRNAs, we find 45 small ORFs to be actively translated, 17 specifically upon differentiation. 15/45 of the translated lncRNA-smORFs exhibit sequence conservation within Hominidea suggesting they are under strong selective constraint in this clade. Profiling of publicly available datasets revealed that 8/45 of the translated lncRNAs are dynamically expressed during human brain development and 22/45 are associated with cancers of the central nervous system. One translated lncRNA we discovered is LINC01116, which is induced upon differentiation and contains an 87 codon smORF exhibiting increased ribosome profiling signal upon differentiation. The resulting LINC01116 peptide localises to neurites. Knockdown of LINC01116 results in a significant reduction of neurite length in differentiated cells indicating it contributes to neuronal differentiation. Our findings indicate cytoplasmic lncRNAs interact with translation complexes, are a non-canonical source of novel peptides, and contribute to neuronal function and disease. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel functional role for LINC01116 during human neuronal differentiation. Overall design: Poly-Ribo-Seq on human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) in 2 conditions: undifferentiated (Control) and differentiated with RA for 3 days."

PRJNA699408,Light-dependent translation change of Arabidopsis chloroplast genes and mRNA structure alterations,"mRNA secondary structure influences translation. Proteins that modulate the mRNA secondary structure around the translation initiation region may regulate translation in plastids. To test this hypothesis, we exposed Arabidopsis thaliana to high light, which induces translation of psbA mRNA encoding the D1 subunit of photosystem II. We assayed translation by ribosome profiling and applied two complementary methods to analyze in vivo RNA secondary structure: DMS-MaPseq and SHAPE-seq. We detected increased accessibility of the translation initiation region of psbA after high light treatment, likely contributing to the observed increase in translation by facilitating translation initiation. This supports the idea that changes in mRNA secondary structure might represent a general mechanism for translational regulation of psbA and other plastid genes."

PRJNA697913,Ultrasensitive Ribo-seq reveals translational landscapes during mammalian oocyte-to-embryo transition and pre-implantation development,"In mammals, translational control plays critical roles during oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) when transcription ceases. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain challenging to study. Here, using low-input Ribo-seq (Ribo-lite), we investigated translational landscapes during OET using 30-150 mouse oocytes or embryos per stage. Ribo-lite can also accommodate single oocytes. Combining PAIso-seq to interrogate poly(A) tail lengths, we found a global switch of translatome that closely parallels changes of poly(A) tails upon meiotic resumption. Translation activation correlates with polyadenylation and is supported by polyadenylation signal proximal cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (papCPEs) in 3' untranslated regions. By contrast, translation repression parallels global de-adenylation. The latter includes transcripts containing no CPEs or non-papCPEs, which encode many transcription regulators that are preferentially re-activated before zygotic genome activation. CCR4-NOT, the major de-adenylation complex, and its key adaptor protein BTG4 regulate translation downregulation often independent of RNA decay. BTG4 is not essential for global de-adenylation but is required for selective gene de-adenylation and production of very short-tailed transcripts. In sum, our data reveal intimate interplays among translation, RNA stability and poly(A) tail length regulation underlying mammalian OET. Overall design: By employing Ribo-seq and RNA-seq, we systematically examined the dynamics of translatome and transcriptome of WT oocytes, WT early embryos, Cnot6l/Btg4 KO oocytes and CHX/DRB treated early embryos."
PRJNA695008,Loss of N1-Methylation of G37 in tRNA Induces  Ribosome Stalling and Reprograms Gene Expression,"N1-methylation of G37 is required for a subset of tRNAs to maintain the translational reading-frame. While loss of m1G37 increases ribosomal +1 frameshifting, whether it incurs additional translational defects is unknown. Here we address this question by applying ribosome profiling to gain a genome-wide view of the effects of m1G37 deficiency on protein synthesis. Using E. coli as a model, we show that m1G37 deficiency induces ribosome stalling at codons that are normally translated by m1G37-containing tRNAs. Stalling occurs during decoding of affected codons at the ribosomal A site, indicating a distinct mechanism than that of +1 frameshifting, which occurs after the affected codons leave the A site. Enzyme- and cell-based assays show that m1G37 deficiency reduces tRNA aminoacylation and in some cases peptide-bond formation. We observe changes of gene expression in m1G37 deficiency similar to those in the stringent response that is typically induced by deficiency of amino acids. This work demonstrates a previously unrecognized function of m1G37 that emphasizes its role throughout the entire elongation cycle of protein synthesis, providing new insight into its essentiality for bacterial growth and survival. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq E. coli cells to study the effects of loss of the tRNA methylase TrmD either by 1) a degron strategy using ClpXP or 2) a knockout strain where Trm5 is expressed initially and then repressed"
PRJNA694918,Dynamic changes in tRNA modifications and abundance during T-cell activation [RNA/Ribo-seq],"The tRNA pool determines the efficiency, throughput, and accuracy of translation. Previous studies have identified dynamic changes in the tRNA supply and mRNA demand during cancerous proliferation. Yet, dynamic changes may occur also during physiologically normal proliferation, and these are less characterized. We examined the tRNA and mRNA pools of T-cells during their vigorous proliferation and differentiation upon triggering of the T cell antigen receptor. We observe a global signature of switch in demand for codon at the early proliferation phase of the response, accompanied by corresponding changes in tRNA expression levels. In the later phase, upon differentiation of the T cells, the response of the tRNA pool is relaxed back to basal level, potentially restraining excessive proliferation. Sequencing of tRNAs allowed us to also evaluate their diverse base-modifications. We found that two types of tRNA modifications, Wybutosine and ms2t6A, are reduced dramatically during T-cell activation. These modifications occur in the anti-codon loops of two tRNAs that decode “slippery codons”, that are prone to ribosomal frameshifting. Attenuation of these frameshift-protective modifications is expected to increase proteome-wide frameshifting during T-cell proliferation. Indeed, human cell lines deleted of a Wybutosine writer showed increased ribosomal frameshifting, as detected with a reporter that consists of a critical frameshifting site taken from the HIV gag-pol slippery codon motif. These results may explain HIV's specificity to proliferating T-Cells since it requires ribosomal frameshift exactly on this codon for infection. The changes in tRNA expression and modifications uncover a new layer of translation regulation during T-cell proliferation and exposes a potential trade-off between cellular growth and translation fidelity.

PRJNA694138,High expression profiling analysis of the early response to spinal cord injury identified a key role for mTORC1 signaling,"Xenopus laevis are able to regenerate the spinal cord during larvae stages through the activation of neural stem progenitor cells (NSPC). Here, we use high-resolution expression profiling to characterize the early transcriptome changes induced after spinal cord injury, and identify the signals that trigger NSPC proliferation. The analysis delineates a pathway that starts with a rapid and transitory activation of immediate early genes, followed by migration processes and immune response genes, the pervasive increase of NSPC specific ribosome biogenesis factors, and genes involved in stem cell proliferation. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis showed that mTORC1 is rapidly and transiently activated after SCI, and its pharmacological inhibition impairs spinal cord regeneration, and proliferation of NSPC of genes involved in the G1/S transition of cell cycle, with a strong effect on PCNA. We propose that the mTOR signaling pathway is a key player in the activation of NPSCs during the early steps of spinal cord regeneration. Overall design: Time-series analysis of the early transcriptional changes deployed in response to spinal cord injury in regenerative stage of Xenopus laevis."
PRJNA692108,Effect of N1-acetylspermidine treatment on the translatome of hair follicle stem cell organoid cultures,"Stem cell differentiation has been shown to involve an increase in mRNA translation. Amongst others, the rate of translation is influenced by availability of the natural polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine that are essential for cell growth and modulate stem cell maintenance. However, the link between polyamines and translation in cell fate decisions remains obscure. Here, we used hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) organoids to study the role of polyamines as key regulators of mRNA translation in stem cell fate decisions. HFSCs showed lower translation and reduced polyamine levels than progenitor cells. Surprisingly, we found that reduced translation achieved by changed polyamine availability and stemness do not correlate in the organoids. We identified N1-acetylspermidine as regulator of cell fate decisions. To investigate the effect on translation upon N1-AcSpd supplementation, we performed ribosome foot pronting. We confirmed the increase in proliferation identified by 3'RNA-sequencing on the translatome level. N1-AcSpd treatment partially aligns the translatome of progenitor cells to that of HFSCs. Overall, this study delineates the diverse routes of polyamine metabolism-mediated regulation of stem cell fate decisions. Overall design: RNA-Seq / Ribo-Seq of sorted HFSC organoids (alpha6+CD34- and alpha6+CD34+ cells), 8 samples, 2 biological replicates, untreated and treated with N1-acetylspermidine for 72h, samples for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were obtained from the same lysis"
PRJNA690830,"A multi-omics approach to characterize the function of two RAP proteins essential for mitochondrial functions in the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum","The RAP (RNA-binding domain abundant in Apicomplexans) protein family has been identified in various organisms. Despite expansion of this protein family in apicomplexan parasites, their biological functions remain unknown in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. In this study, we used inducible knockdown studies to show that PF3D7_0105200 (RAP01) and PF3D7_1470600 (RAP21) are essential for parasite survival and localize to the mitochondrion. Using transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics profiling experiments, we further demonstrated that these RAP proteins are involved in RNA metabolism and mitochondrial activity. Finally, using high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (eCLIP-seq), we validated that RAP01 and RAP21 are true RNA-binding proteins and interact specifically with mitochondrial rRNAs, indicating a role in regulating mitochondrial ribosome function. Collectively, our results establish the role of these RAP proteins in mitochondrial functions and contribute to further understanding of mitoribosome in malaria parasites."

PRJNA689830,Landscape of transcriptional and translational changes over 22 years of bacterial adaptation,"We use RNA-seq and Ribo-seq to analyze expression changes in the Long Term Evolution Experiment. By comparing expression levels between the ancestral strains and each of the evolved lines, we find that expression changes are largely parallel after 22 years of evolution, that these changes occur in specific pathways, and that known mutations may be responsible for some of the observed expression changes. Overall design: 2 biological replicates each of RNA-seq and Ribo-seq of 13 E. coli cell lines. AraM and AraP refer to the 6 evolved lines of the ancestral REL606 and REL607 strains, respectively. Each file contains the data for the indicated biological replicate (rep1 or rep2), the indicated sequencing method (RNA-seq or ribo-seq), and the indicated cell lines (Ara-1-6 or Ara+1-6 and the corresponding ancestor).

PRJDB10882,Ribosome profiling in Streptococcus pneumoniae reveals the role of methylation of 23S rRNA nucleotide G748 on ribosome stalling.,"Many nucleotides methylated post-transcriptionally by methyltransferases in 23S rRNA are clustered around the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) and the nascent peptidyl exit tunnel (NPET) located in 50S subunit of 70S ribosome. Biochemical interactions between the nascent peptide and the tunnel may stall the ribosome movement and thus affect the expression level of the protein being synthesized. However no studies have actually shown the role of NPET on the ribosome stalling using NPET mutant. By establishing the ribosome profiling assay in Streptococcus pneumoniae, we show for the first time that NPET mutant exhibits completely different ribosome occupancy compared to wild-type strain. Using RNA footprinting assay, we demonstrate that the observed change in the ribosome occupancy corresponds to the change in ribosome stalling. Further statistical analysis shows the short peptide sequences that cause ribosome stalling are specie-specific and evolutionary selected, and NPET structure is required to realize these characteristics. The reported results support the role of NPET on ribosome stalling. NPET structure is required to realize the specie-specific and evolutionary conserved ribosome stalling. These findings throw light on the role of the NPET structure on the translation process."
PRJNA687815,Effect of high glucose environment on transcriptome expression profile of islet bata cell line,"Objective To study the effect of high concentration of glucose on the transcriptome expression profile of islet bata cell line in type 1 diabetes (T1D) mice and to explore the possible mechanism of high glucose environmental factors in the pathogenesis of T1D. Methods The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice-derived islet bata cell line NIT-1 cells in logarithmic growth phase were divided into high glucose-treated (HG) and control (NIT1) group.The cells in NIT1 group were routinely cultured in F-12K medium, while HG group were treated with high concentration of 20mM glucose. Whole whole-transcriptome profiling was analyzed using RNA-sequencing technology to obtain the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). and the DEGs were further analyzed by GO annotation and KEGG Pathway enrichment analysis. Results A total of 5548 DEGs were detected between NIT1 group and HG group. Among them, 2701 DEGs were upregulated in HG group, which were significantly enriched in endoplasmic reticulum stress, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, insulin signal regulation pathway, ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, autophagy, apoptosis, antigen processing and presentation pathways.And 2847 down-regulated genes are mainly concentrated in ribosome, metabolism, biosynthesis, cell cycle, DNA replication and biological processes such as DNA damage repair, translation, cell division and RNA processing Moreover, mRNA expression levels of important T1D autoantigens, such as Insulin and Chromogranin A, were significantly increased in the HG group. Conclusion The expression of autoantigen-related genes in islet bata-cell lines changed significantly under high glucose environment, and the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress, protein degradation, processing presentation and autophagy pathway-related genes were also up-regulated. It is suggested that high glucose stimulation changes the expression of islet bata-cell line transcriptional group, and these changes may be related to the occurrence and development of T1D."

PRJNA684635,Translating mRNA profiling in resistance to Verticillium wilt in cotton,"Research on plant-pathogen interactions obtained from transcriptional level by next-generation sequencing technologies or microarray chips may not reflect the actual expression levels of the proteins that are the executors of biological processes in cells. Regulatory mechanisms during the post-transcriptional and translational phases may be more important in governing the protein expression levels in cells. Research has shown that full-length translating mRNA profiling, or ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound RNA sequencing (RNC-seq) better reflects protein expression and abundance. We used the the RNC-seq method in addition to the traditional mRNA-seq method to reveal post-transcriptional regulations of gene expression in a verticillium-susceptible Gossypium hirsutum TM-1 in response to V. dahliae inoculation."
PRJNA684590,RiboTag RNA-seq transcriptomic profiling of Tamoxifen-activated PKP2-knockout mice (PKP2cKO) hearts,"We determined the transcriptome specific to cardiomyocytes by crossing PKP2cKO mice with a RiboTag murine line. Active Cre-recombinase leads to expression of a Ribosomal Protein L22 (RPL22) that is modified in exon 4 to code for a 3-repeat HA tag (3HA). RPL22-3HA is expressed and incorporated into the ribosome particle, allowing its precipitation and subsequent detection of associated transcripts by RNA-seq. Given that Cre-ERT2 expression in our mice was controlled by the alphaMHC promoter, injection of TAM led to both, loss of PKP2 expression and expression of RPL22-3HA. We refer to this line as PKP2cKO/RiboTag."

PRJNA683007,Transcriptome-wide investigation of stop codon readthrough in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Translation of mRNA into a polypeptide is terminated when the release factor eRF1 recognizes a UAA, UAG, or UGA stop codon in the ribosomal A site and stimulates nascent peptide release. However, stop codon readthrough can occur when a near-cognate tRNA outcompetes eRF1 in decoding the stop codon, resulting in the continuation of the elongation phase of protein synthesis. At the end of a conventional mRNA coding region readthrough allows translation into the mRNA 3'-UTR. Previous studies with reporter systems have shown that the efficiency of termination or readthrough is modulated by cis-acting elements other than stop codon identity, including two nucleotides 5' of the stop codon, six nucleotides 3' of the stop codon in the ribosomal mRNA channel, and stem-loop structures in the mRNA 3'-UTR. It is unknown whether these elements are important at a genome-wide level and whether other mRNA features proximal to the stop codon significantly affect termination and readthrough efficiencies in vivo. Accordingly, we carried out ribosome profiling analyses of yeast cells expressing wild-type or temperature-sensitive eRF1 and developed bioinformatics strategies to calculate readthrough efficiency, and to identify mRNA and peptide features which influence that efficiency. We found that the stop codon (nt +1 to +3), the nucleotide after it (nt +4), the codon in the P site (nt -3 to -1), and 3'-UTR length are the most influential features in the control of readthrough efficiency, while nts +5 to +9 and mRNA secondary structure in the 3'-UTR had milder effects. Additionally, we found low readthrough genes to have shorter 3'-UTRs compared to high readthrough genes in cells with thermally inactivated eRF1, while this trend was reversed in wild-type cells. Together, our results demonstrated the general roles of known regulatory elements in genome-wide regulation and identified several new mRNA or peptide features important for translation termination and readthrough. Overall design: Translation profiles of the WT and sup45-2 strains were generated by ribosome profiling in duplicates using Illumina NextSeq 500. Readthrough efficiency of each gene was defined as the rato of ribosome density of the extension (region between the canonical stop and the first in-frame downstream stop in the 3'-UTR) to ribosome density of the coding region. For each sample, random forest algorithm was used to identify significant predictors of readthrough efficiency.."
PRJNA682206,Mutations in distinct translation-dependent quality control pathways lead to convergent molecular pathogenesis and neurodevelopmental defects.,"Translation-dependent quality control pathways govern protein synthesis and proteostasis by degrading potentially toxic peptide products derived from aberrant mRNAs. However, little is known about the in vivo defects that arise in the absence of these pathways and how translation is altered in the absence of these pathways. Here, we demonstrate that the ribosome rescue factors Pelo/Hbs1l are both critical for embryonic and neuronal development but dispensable for neuronal survival in the adult brain. Loss of Pelo/Hbs1l in cerebellar progenitors impaired differentiation of these cells. Our analysis of Pelo/Hbs1l deficient fibroblasts revealed translational reprogramming of multiple pathways including mTORC1 signaling likely to restore cellular homeostasis. Interestingly, similar affects on the translatome, signaling pathways and neurogenesis were observed when we conditionally deleted Upf2 to inhibit NMD. These data reveal that translation-dependent quality control pathways, which set out to mitigate errors in translation and to clear defective peptide products and aberrant mRNAs can trigger similar cellular responses and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Overall design: 41 samples are analyzed in this study which include RNA-seq and Ribosome footprint profiling data from mouse tissues with knockouts of different translation-dependent quality control genes. Profiling datasets include 3 replicates of Hbs1l global knockout from whole mouse embryos with paired wildtype controls. Ribosome profiling datasets also include 3 replicates of Hbs1l conditional knockout in cerebellum with matched wildtype controls. There are also RNA-seq and ribosome footprint profiling for Cre-induced knockouts from mouse embryonic fibroblasts of Pelo, Hbs1l, and Upf2, as well as Cre control samples. There are 3 replicates each with the exception of a Pelo RNA-seq sample which was excluded due to being a biological outlier. The matched Cre controls for profiling datasets are included with knockouts in each batch."
PRJNA681523,SARS-CoV-2 utilizes a multipronged strategy to suppress host protein synthesis,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite the urgent need, we still do not fully understand the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its ability to antagonize innate immune responses. Here, we use RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling along SARS-CoV-2 infection and comprehensively define the mechanisms that are utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to shutoff cellular protein synthesis. We show SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a global reduction in translation but that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated. Instead, we reveal that infection leads to accelerated degradation of cytosolic cellular mRNAs which facilitates viral takeover of the mRNA pool in infected cells. Moreover, we show that the translation of transcripts whose expression is induced in response to infection, including innate immune genes, is impaired, implying infection prevents newly transcribed cellular mRNAs from accessing the ribosomes. Overall, our results uncover the multipronged strategy employed by SARS-CoV-2 to commandeer the translation machinery and to suppress host defenses. Overall design: To gain a detailed view of the changes that occur in viral and host translation over the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we applied ribosome profiling and RNA-sequencing to Calu3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as uninfected cells. The cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1/2020 Ref-SKU: 026V-03883 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 3, resulting in infection of the majority of the cells, and harvested at 3, 5, and 8 hours post infection ( hpi ) . For each time point, we monitored transcriptome-wide translation levels by preparing ribosome profiling libraries from cells treated with the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide ( CHX ) . In parallel, we prepared RNA-seq libraries following poly-A selection to generate a detailed depiction of transcript levels. In addition, in order to measure total RNA levels and rRNA levels, we prepared RNA-seq libraries from total RNA without poly-A selection or rRNA depletion. Two independent biological replicates were prepared for all libraries from uninfected cells and from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 8 hours.To directly evaluate mRNA decay during SARS-CoV-2 infection we employed SLAM-seq on Calu-3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as uninfected cells. This approach allows to measure endogenous mRNA half-lives based on 4-thiouridine ( 4sU ) incorporation into new RNA during transcription. After RNA extraction, 4sU is converted to a cytosine analogue using iodoacetamide, and these U to C conversions are identified and quantified by RNA sequencing. The cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1/2020 Ref-SKU: 026V-03883 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 3, resulting in infection of the majority of the cells, or left uninfected, labeled with 4sU at 3hpi and harvested at 4, 5, 6 and 7 hpi. Following iodoacetamide-conversion RNA was used to prepare poly-A selected libraries. Two biological replicates were prepared from uninfected cells and infected cells at 5hpi, following 2 hours of 4sU labeling. To test if SARS-CoV-2 interferes with nuclear mRNA export, Calu3 cells were left uninfected or infected with SARS-CoV-2 and subcellular localization of polyadenylated transcripts was assessed by cytoplasmic/nuclear (Cyto/Nuc) fractionation followed by RNA-seq. RNA was extracted from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions in parallel to whole cell from the same samples. Two biological replicates were prepared from all samples."
PRJNA680923,OXPHOS deficiency activates global adaptation pathways to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential,"Reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential is a hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction. It activates adaptive responses in organisms from yeast to human to rewire metabolism, remove depolarized mitochondria, and degrade unimported precursor proteins. It remains unclear how cells maintain mitochondrial membrane potential, which is critical for maintaining iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) synthesis, an indispensable function of mitochondria. Here we show that yeast oxidative phosphorylation mutants deficient in complex III, IV, V, and mtDNA respectively, have graded reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and proliferation rates. Extensive omics analyses of these mutants show that accompanying mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, these mutants progressively activate adaptive responses, including transcriptional downregulation of ATP synthase inhibitor Inh1 and OXPHOS subunits, Puf3-mediated upregulation of import receptor Mia40 and global mitochondrial biogenesis, Snf1/AMPK-mediated upregulation of glycolysis and repression of ribosome biogenesis, and transcriptional upregulation of cytoplasmic chaperones. These adaptations disinhibit mitochondrial ATP hydrolysis, remodel mitochondrial proteome, and optimize ATP supply to mitochondria to convergently maintain mitochondrial membrane potential, ISC biosynthesis, and cell proliferation. Overall design: 1. Differential expression analysis between OXPHOS mutants and WT cells. 2. Examination of gene expression upon PUF3 deletion in WT, atp7D and r0 cells. 3. Examination of gene expression upon blocking Puf3 hyperphosphorylation in WT and r0 cells. 4. Examination of gene expression upon SNF1 deletion in WT and r0 cells. 5. Examination of gene expression upon INH1 overexpression in r0 cells. 6. Examination of gene expression upon MIG1 deletion in snf1 r0 cells. 7.

PRJNA680784,Spurious regulatory connections dictate the expression-fitness landscape of translation factors,"During steady-state cell growth, individual enzymatic fluxes can be directly inferred from growth rate by mass conservation, but the inverse problem remains unsolved. Perturbing the flux and expression of a single enzyme could have pleiotropic effects that may or may not dominate the impact on cell fitness. Here, we quantitatively dissect the molecular and global responses to varied expression of translation termination factors (peptide release factors, RFs) in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. While endogenous RF expression maximizes proliferation, deviations in expression lead to unexpected distal regulatory responses that dictate fitness reduction. Molecularly, RF depletion causes expression imbalance at specific operons, which activates master regulators and detrimentally overrides the transcriptome. Through these spurious connections, RF abundances are thus entrenched by focal points within the regulatory network, in one case located at a single stop codon. Such regulatory entrenchment suggests that predictive bottom-up models of expression-fitness landscapes will require near-exhaustive characterization Overall design: 26 competition experiment amplicon libraries from strain pools, 12 matched Rend-seq and ribosome profiling datasets, one individual Rend-seq dataset, 56 RNA-seq datasets.

PRJNA680481,Ribosomal profiling in single cells reveals cell-cycle dependent translational pausing,"In recent years novel single-cell sequencing methods have allowed an in-depth analysis of the diversity of cell types and cell states in a wide range of organisms. These novel tools predominantly focus on sequencing the genomes, epigenomes, and transcriptomes of single cells. However, despite recent progress in detecting proteins by mass spectrometry with single-cell resolution, it remains a major challenge to measure translation in individual cells. Building upon existing ribosome profiling protocols, we majorly increased the sensitivity of these assays allowing ribosome profiling in single cells. Integrated with a machine learning approach, this technology achieves single codon resolution in individual cells. We validate this method by demonstrating that limitation for a particular amino acid causes ribosome pausing at a subset of the codons representing this amino acid. Interestingly, this pausing is only observed in a sub-population of cells correlating to its cell-cycle state. We further corroborate this phenomenon in non-limiting conditions and detect pronounced GAA pausing during mitosis. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of this technique to rare primary enteroendocrine cells. This new technology provides the first steps towards determining the contribution of the translational process to the astonishing diversity between seemingly identical cells. Overall design: Ribosome profiling in single HEK293T and hTERT-RPE1 FUCCI cells."
PRJNA680364,Ribosome profiling of H9 PUS7KO,"Transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived fragments (tRF) are emerging small noncoding (nc) RNAs that, while commonly altered in cancer, have poorly defined roles in tumorigenesis. Here we show that pseudouridylation (Y) of a stem-cell-enriched tRF subtype, mTOG, selectively modulates malignant protein synthesis programs, thereby promoting differentiation of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). Building on evidence that mTOG targets the polyadenylate-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), we employed isotope exchange proteomics to reveal critical interactions between mTOG and functional RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domains in PABPC1. Mechanistically, this hinders the recruitment of the translational co-activator PABPC1-interacting protein 1 (PAIP1)3 and selectively represses translation of transcripts sharing pyrimidine-enriched sequences (PES) in their 5'UTR including 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tracts (TOP) that encode protein machinery components, and are frequently altered in cancer4. Significantly, mTOG dysregulation leads to aberrant 5'PES mRNA translation in malignant MDS-HSPC and is clinically associated with leukemic transformation and decreased patient survival. Taken together, these results unveil a critical role for tRF and Y in difficult-to-treat subsets of MDS characterized by high risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia.

PRJNA680357,Direct epitranscriptomic regulation of mammalian translation initiation through N4-acetylcytidine,"mRNA function is influenced by modifications that modulate canonical nucleobase behavior. We show that a single modification mediates distinct impacts on mRNA translation in a position-dependent manner. While cytidine acetylation (ac4C) within protein-coding sequences stimulates translation, ac4C within 5'UTRs impacts protein synthesis at the level of initiation. 5'UTR acetylation promotes initiation at upstream sequences, competitively inhibiting annotated start codons. Acetylation further directly impedes initiation at optimal AUG contexts: ac4C within AUG-flanking Kozak sequences reduced initiation in base-resolved transcriptome-wide HeLa results, and in vitro utilizing substrates with site-specific ac4C incorporation. Cryo-EM of mammalian 80S initiation complexes revealed ac4C in the -1-position adjacent to an AUG start codon disrupts an interaction between C and hypermodified t6A at nucleotide 37 of the initiator tRNA. These findings demonstrate the impact of RNA modifications on nucleobase function at a molecular level and introduce mRNA acetylation as a factor regulating translation in a location-specific manner. Overall design: Detection of acetylated cytidine in RNA with a novel method (RedaC:T-seq), via chemical reduction of ac4C with sodium borohydride.

PRJDB10544,Ribosome profiling in Arabidopsis T87 cultured cell,"In gene expression, DNA is transcribed to mRNA, and mRNA is translated to protein. In these steps, translation is one of the important steps to determine the protein abundance. To evaluate translation efficiencies, ribosome profiling is reported in previous study. This method is based on deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments, and provides a snapshot of all the ribosomes abundance at a specific time point. This information provide the ribosome position or ribosome occupancy on mRNAs. Thus, we conducted ribosome profiling using 3 day after inoculation of Arabidopsis T87 cultured cell to evaluate translation efficiencies and analyze the relationships between sequence feature and translation process."
PRJNA679768,Analysis of differential gene expression in the choroid plexus (ChP) of P60 mice at 9am and 9pm,"3 mice per timepoint (9am and 9pm) with FoxJ1-Cre x TRAP-BAC-EGFP:L10a dissected choroid plexus. Transmission and secretion of signals via the choroid plexus (ChP) brain barrier can modulate brain states via regulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition. Here, we developed a platform to analyze diurnal variations in male mouse ChP and CSF. Ribosome profiling of ChP epithelial cells revealed diurnal translatome differences in metabolic machinery, secreted proteins, and barrier components. Using ChP and CSF metabolomics and blood-CSF barrier analyses, we observed diurnal changes in metabolites and cellular junctions. We then focused on transthyretin (TTR), a diurnally regulated thyroid hormone chaperone secreted by the ChP. Diurnal variation in ChP TTR depended on Bmal1 clock gene expression. We achieved real-time tracking of CSF-TTR in awake TtrmNeonGreen mice via multi-day intracerebroventricular fiber photometry. Diurnal changes in ChP and CSF TTR levels correlated with CSF thyroid hormone levels. These datasets highlight an integrated platform for investigating diurnal control of brain states by the ChP and CSF. Overall design: TRAP mRNAs were isolated and sequenced from the choroid plexus (ChP) of P60 mice"
PRJNA678725,Profiling NSD3-dependent neural crest gene expression reveals known and novel candidate regulatory factors,"The lysine methyltransferase NSD3 is required for the expression of key neural crest transcription factors and the migration of neural crest cells. Nevertheless, a complete view of the genes dependent upon NSD3 for expression and the developmental processes impacted by NSD3 in the neural crest was lacking. We used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile transcripts differentially expressed after NSD3 knockdown in chick premigratory neural crest cells, identifying 674 genes. Gene Ontology and gene set enrichment analyses further support a requirement for NSD3 during neural crest development and show that NSD3 knockdown also upregulates ribosome biogenesis. To validate our results, we selected three genes not previously associated with neural crest development, Astrotactin-1 (Astn1), Dispatched-3 (Disp3), and Tropomyosin-1 (Tpm1). Using whole mount in situ hybridization, we show that premigratory neural crest cells express these genes and that NSD3 knockdown downregulates (Astn1 and Disp3) and upregulates (Tpm1) their expression, consistent with RNA-seq results. Altogether, this study identifies novel putative regulators of neural crest development and provides insight into the transcriptional consequences of NSD3 in the neural crest, with implications for cancer. Overall design: NSD3-dependent gene expression in chick neural folds is profiled by RNA-seq with 5 control and 5 knockdown replicates."

PRJNA677870,N7-methylguanosine tRNA modification enhances oncogenic mRNA translation and promotes intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progression,"The cancer cells selectively promote translation of specific oncogenic transcripts to facilitate cancer survival and progression, while the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. N7-methylguanosine (m7G) tRNA modification and its methyltransferase complex METTL1/WDR4 are significantly up-regulated in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and associated with poor prognosis. We developed tRNA reduction and cleavage sequencing (TRAC-Seq) to reveal the m7G tRNA methylome inICC cell line and ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound mRNAs sequencing(RNC-seq) and ribosome profiling(Ribo-seq) to study the differential translated genes and reveal the ribosome pausing. A subset of 22 tRNAs is modified at a 'RAGGU' motif within the variable loop. We observe increased ribosome occupancy at the corresponding codons in the Mettl1 knockdown ICC cell line implying widespread effects on tRNA function, ribosome pausing, and mRNA translation. Translation of cell cycle genes and EGFR signaling pathway genes is particularly affected. Our study uncovers the important physiological function and mechanism of METTL1-mediated m7G tRNA modification in the regulation of cancer progression. Overall design: TRAC-Seq was developed to identify the tRNA m7G methylome in the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell line.

PRJNA676161,RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq analysis of contol and  METTL3 inducible shRNA LNCaP lines with and without doxycycline induction,"Genomic and transcriptomic alterations are insufficient to explain the variance in protein expression seen in cancer. Recent evidence has highlighted the role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in the regulation of mRNA expression, stability and translation, supporting a potential role for post-transcriptional regulation mediated by m6A in cancer. Here we explore prostate cancer as an exemplar cancer and generate the first prostate m6A maps, and further examined how low levels of N6-adenosine-methyltransferase (METTL3) associates with advanced prostate cancer and results in altered expression at the level of transcription, translation, and protein. In particular extracellular matrix proteins have a high number of m6A sites and show significant changes in expression with METTL3 knock-down. We also discovered the upregulation of a hepatocyte nuclear factor-driven gene signature that is associated with therapy resistance in prostate cancer. Significantly, METTL3 knock-down rendered the cells resistant to androgen receptor antagonists, implicating changes in m6A as a mechanism for therapy resistance in metastatic prostate cancer. Overall design: RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq analysis of contol and  METTL3 inducible shRNA LNCaP lines with and without doxycycline induction."

We found that in addition to decreasing antibiotic uptake through anr operon activation and subsequent LPS modification, Pae responds to colistin by launching an anti-oxidative response and by up-regulating genes belonging to the MexT regulon. Concerning tobramycin, Pae seemingly goes through metabolic changes and envelope remodeling to prevent tobramycin uptake, whereas its ramifications on translational processes are met with stalled ribosome rescue response and activation of type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems."

PRJNA675749,Mettl3-/Mettl14-mediated mRNA N6-methyladenosine modulates murine spermatogenesis,"Spermatogenesis is precisely controlled at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels. Here we report that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), an epitranscriptomic mark regulating gene expression, plays essential roles during spermatogenesis. We present comprehensive m6A mRNA methylomes of mouse spermatogenic cells from five developmental stages: undifferentiated spermatogonia, type A1 spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, pachytene/diplotene spermatocytes, and round spermatids. Germ cell-specific inactiva- tion of the m6A RNA methyltransferase Mettl3 or Mettl14 with Vasa-Cre causes loss of m6A and depletion of SSCs. m6A depletion dysregulates translation of transcripts that are required for SSC proliferation/differentiation. Com- bined deletion of Mettl3 and Mettl14 in advanced germ cells with Stra8-GFPCre disrupts spermiogenesis, whereas mice with single deletion of either Mettl3 or Mettl14 in advanced germ cells show normal spermatogenesis. The sper- matids from double-mutant mice exhibit impaired translation of haploid-specific genes that are essential for spermio- genesis. This study highlights crucial roles of mRNA m6A modification in germline development, potentially ensuring coordinated translation at different stages of spermatogenesis. Overall design: Undifferentiated spermatogonia, type A1 spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, pachytene/diplotene spermatocytes, and round spermatids were isolated from wild-type mice (B6 background ) to perform m6A-seq. Undifferentiated spermatogonia from 5-day-old wild-type, Mettl3-vKO and Mettl14-vKO mice were isolated to perform ribosome profiling and RNA-seq. Pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids from wild-type and Mettl3/14-sKO were isolated to perform ribosome profiling and RNA-seq."

The global transcriptome and translatome reflecting the cellular response to hypoxia have not yet been extensively studied in myocardium. In this study, adult rats were subjected to acute normobaric hypoxia at 10% oxygen with 10 min (mild hypoxia) and 30 min (severe hypoxia). Rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes were treated with the culture condition (1% O2, 94% N2, and 5% CO2) for mild hypoxia (8 hr) and severe hypoxia(24 hr). We then conducted RNA-seq and Ribo-seq in non-infarcted left ventricular myocardial tissues and H9C2 cells exposed to different periods of hypoxia stress in vivo and in vitro."
PRJNA673802,Bacterial ribosome pause sites surveyed by an integration of ribosome profiling and nascent chain profiling,"Ribosome pauses are associated with diverse co-translational events and determine the fate of mRNAs and proteins. Thus the identification of the precise pause sites across transcriptome is a key, however, the landscape in bacterial has remained ambiguous. Here, we harnessed the multiple ribosome profiling strategies (standard, high-salt-wash, and disome) to survey the robust ribosome pause sites in E. coli. The found pause sites showed the correspondence with biochemical validation by integrated nascent chain profiling (iNP), which detects polypeptidyl-tRNA, an elongation intermediate. Among the list, ribosome pause at Asn586 of ycbZ was ensured by biochemical reporter assay, tRNA-seq, and cryo-electron microscopy. Our results provide a useful resource of ribosome stalling sites in bacteria. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and tRNA"

We demonstrate that RNMT has gene-specific impacts in T cells, selectively regulating expression of terminal polypyrimidine tract (TOP) mRNAs which are targets of the m7G-cap binding protein LARP1. These ribosome footprinting experiments investigate the effect of Rnmt cKO on the activated CD4 T cell transcriptome and translatome.

PRJNA672869,Spectral prediction features as a solution for the database size problem in proteogenomics,"Proteogenomics approaches often struggle with the distinction between right and false peptide-to-spectrum matches as the database size enlarges. However, features extracted from tandem mass spectrometry intensity predictors can enhance the peptide identification rate and can provide extra confidence for spectral matching in a proteogenomic context. To that end, features from the spectral intensity pattern predictors MS2PIP and Prosit were combined with the canonical scores from MaxQuant in the Percolator post-processing tool for protein databases constructed from RNA-seq (nanopore cDNA sequencing) and ribosome profiling analyses. The presented results provide evidence that this approach enhances the peptide identification power in a proteogenomic setting and in the meantime they lead to the validation of new proteoforms with elevated stringency."
PRJNA672335,eEF3 promotes late stages of tRNA translocation on the ribosome,"In addition to the conserved translation elongation factors eEF1A and eEF2, fungi require a third essential elongation factor, eEF3. While eEF3 has been implicated in tRNA binding and release at the A and E sites, its exact mechanism of action is unclear. Here we show that eEF3 acts at the mRNA–tRNA translocation step by promoting the dissociation of the tRNA from the E site, but independent of aminoacyl-tRNA recruitment to the A site. Depletion of eEF3 in vivo leads to a general slow-down in translation elongation due to accumulation of ribosomes with an occupied A site. Cryo-EM analysis of native eEF3-ribosome complexes shows that eEF3 facilitates late steps of translocation by favoring non-rotated ribosomal states as well as by opening the L1 stalk to release the E-site tRNA. Additionally, our analysis provides structural insights into novel translation elongation states, enabling presentation of a revised yeast translation elongation cycle. Overall design: 5 biological samples are included for ribosome profiling libaries prepared with CHX+TIG or CHX+ANS in the lysis buffer."
PRJNA670703,The biochemical basis of mitochondrial dysfunction in Zellweger Spectrum Disorder ,"Peroxisomal Biogenesis Disorders (PBDs) are genetic disorders of peroxisome biogenesis and metabolism that are characterized by profound developmental and neurological phenotypes. The most severe class of PBDs—Zellweger Spectrum Disorder (ZSD)—is caused by mutations in peroxin genes that result in both non-functional peroxisomes and mitochondrial dysfunction. It is unclear, however, how defective peroxisomes contribute to mitochondrial impairment. In order to understand the molecular basis of this inter-organellar relationship, we investigated the fate of peroxisomal mRNAs and proteins in ZSD model systems. We found that peroxins were still expressed and a subset of them accumulated on the mitochondrial membrane, which resulted in gross mitochondrial abnormalities and impaired mitochondrial metabolic function. We showed that overexpression of ATAD1, a mitochondrial quality control factor, was sufficient to rescue several aspects of mitochondrial function in human ZSD fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest that aberrant peroxisomal protein localization is necessary and sufficient for the devastating mitochondrial morphological and metabolic phenotypes in ZSDs. Overall design: 4 total S. cerevisiae samples with 1 RNA-seq and 1 Ribosome-footprint profiling entry for each sample"
PRJNA670552,Hepatocyte-specific IL11 cis-signaling drives lipotoxicity and underlies the transition from NAFLD to NASH,"IL11 is important for fibrosis in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) but its role beyond the liver stroma is unclear. Here, we investigate the role of IL11 in hepatocyte lipotoxicity. Hepatocytes express IL11RA and secrete IL11 in response to lipid loading. Autocrine IL11 activity causes hepatocyte death through NOX4-derived ROS, activation of ERK, JNK and caspase-3, impaired mitochondrial function and reduced fatty acid oxidation. Paracrine IL11 activity stimulates hepatic stellate cells and causes fibrosis. In mouse models of NASH, hepatocyte-specific deletion of Il11ra1 protects against liver steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation while reducing serum glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels and limiting obesity. In mice deleted for Il11ra1, restoration of IL11 cis-signaling in hepatocytes reconstitutes steatosis and inflammation. We found no evidence for the existence of IL6 or IL11 trans-signaling in hepatocytes or NASH. These data show that IL11 modulates hepatocyte metabolism and suggests a mechanism for NAFLD to NASH transition. The Ribo-seq and RNA-seq .bam files in this submission include alignment reads for IL11R, IL6R and GP130 as presented in the publication."

This output from bone-marrow residing hematopoietic stem cells is tightly regulated by transcription factors and epigenetic modifications. Whether and how non-coding RNAs such as circular RNAs (circRNAs) contribute to the differentiation and/or identity of hematopoietic cells is to date not well understood. We recently published a circRNA expression map of hematopoietic cells, which showed that erythrocytes and platelets contain the highest levels and numbers of circRNAs. Whether and how circRNA expression alters during differentiation of erythrocytes and platelet precursors is however not known. Therefore, we here provide the first detailed and comprehensive analysis of circRNA expression during red blood cell and megakaryocyte differentiation. CircRNA expression significantly increased during erythroid precursor differentiation into red blood cells, and in differentiating megakaryocytes, in particular upon enucleation. Many functions have been attributed to circRNAs. To dissect their possible function in hematopoietic differentiation, we first focused on translation regulation. We compared circRNA and mRNA expression to ribosomal foot printing data, and found that only 20 (2.6%) circRNAs associated with translation regulation of their mRNA counterparts. We also identified thousands of putative open reading frames in circRNAs, suggesting that circRNAs may also encode proteins. However, deep ribosome-footprinting sequencing data and in-depth mass spectrometry data analysis provided little evidence for translation of endogenously expressed circRNAs in erythroblasts, megakaryocytes and platelets. In conclusion, circRNAs in platelets and red blood cells are highly abundant and alter their expression profile during differentiation, yet their contribution to regulate cellular processes remains enigmatic.

PRJNA668372,Sensing of individual stalled 80S ribosomes by Fap1 for non-functional rRNA turnover. Li et al,"Cells can respond to stalled ribosomes by sensing ribosome collisions and employing quality control pathways. How ribosome stalling is resolved without collisions, however, has remained elusive. Here, focusing on non-colliding stalling exhibited by decoding-defective ribosomes, we identified Fap1 as a stalling sensor triggering 18S non-functional rRNA decay via poly-ubiquitination of uS3. Ribosome profiling revealed an enrichment of Fap1 at the translation initiation site but also association with elongating individual ribosomes. Cryo-EM structures of Fap1-bound ribosomes elucidated Fap1 probing the mRNA simultaneously at both the entry and exit channels suggesting a mRNA stasis sensing activity, and Fap1 sterically hinders formation of canonical collided di-ribosomes. Our findings indicate that individual stalled ribosomes are the potential signal for ribosome dysfunction, leading to accelerated turnover of the ribosome itself. Overall design: 20 ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) samples are included in the study. Ribo-seq samples were obtained from (1) total cell lysates (input) collected prior to purification, (2) MS2-purified ribosomes carrying exogenously encoded wild type or mutant rRNA, or (3) co-purified ribosomes from pull-downs of proteins of interest (Mag2, Fap1, or Yil161w). Input samples serve as controls that are compared against purified ribosomes. Each sample has a biological replicate."
PRJNA667952,Relaxed initiation pausing of ribosomes drives oncogenic translation,"Using quantitative profiling of initiating ribosomes, we found that ribosomal pausing at the start codon serves as a “brake” to restrain the translational output. In response to oncogenic RAS signaling, the initiation pausing relaxes and contributes to the increased translational flux. Intriguingly, mRNA m6A modification in the vicinity of start codons influences the behavior of initiating ribosomes. Under oncogenic RAS signaling, the reduced mRNA methylation leads to relaxed initiation pausing, thereby promoting malignant transformation and tumor growth. Restored initiation pausing by inhibiting m6A demethylases suppresses RAS-mediated oncogenic translation and subsequent tumorigenesis. Our findings unveil a new paradigm of translational control that is co-opted by RAS mutant cancer cells to drive malignant phenotypes. Overall design: We took advantage of a human TtH cell line stably expressing a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible ER:HRASG12V fusion protein. QTI-seq, Ribo-seq, RNA-seq, m6A-seq and corresponding experiments were performed on the ER:HRASG12V cells with or without 4-OHT treatment and METTL3 or FTO knockdown."

The goal of this study is to define the translational landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells using a combination of RNA-seq and ribo-seq approches, the latter being a powerful proxy for protein-level changes. Methods: Vero E6 and primary human bronchial epithelial cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at varying multiplicities of infection and followed throughout early and late phases of infection.  Parallel samples were processed for RNA-seq and Ribo-seq. Sequencing reads were cleaned off of adapters and rRNAs. Reads were first mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome and then to the African green monkey and human genomes using STAR. Mapped reads were further annotated and processed using publicly available software and custom scripts deposited at Github. DE gene expression analysis was performed usign EdgeR. Gene set enrichment analysis was done using TcGSA. Results: We provide the transcriptomic and translatomic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells from multiple RNA-seq and ribo-seq libraries. We found that the robust transcriptional upregulation of numerous chemokines and cytokines are translationally blocked in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of viral and host translational landscape in infected cells and demonstrate that translation of host mRNAs involved in innate immunity is specifically blocked. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for translational profiling studies in other settings. Overall design: Vero E6 and primary human bronchial epithelial cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at varying multiplicities of infection and followed throughout early and late phases of infection.

PRJNA666681,Bidirectional perisomatic inhibitory plasticity of a Fos neuronal network [Ribotag],"Behavioral experiences activate the Fos transcription factor (TF) in sparse populations of neurons that are critical for encoding and recalling specific events. However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms by which experience drives circuit reorganization to establish a network of Fos-activated cells. Additionally, it is unknown if Fos is required in this process beyond serving as a marker of recent neural activity and, if so, which of its many gene targets underlie circuit reorganization. Here we demonstrate that when mice engage in spatial exploration of novel environments, perisomatic inhibition of Fos-expressing hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons by parvalbumin (PV)-interneurons (INs) is enhanced, while perisomatic inhibition by cholecystokinin (CCK)-INs is weakened. This bidirectional modulation of inhibition is specific to Fos-expressing neurons and is abolished when the function of the Fos TF complex is disrupted. Single-cell RNA-sequencing, ribosome-associated mRNA profiling, and chromatin analyses, combined with electrophysiology reveal that Fos activates the transcription of Scg2 (secretogranin II), a gene that encodes multiple distinct neuropeptides, to coordinate these changes in inhibition. As PV- and CCK-INs mediate distinct features of pyramidal cell activity, the Scg2-dependent reorganization of inhibitory synaptic input might be predicted to affect network function in vivo. Consistent with this prediction, hippocampal gamma rhythms and pyramidal cell coupling to CA1 theta are significantly altered with loss of Scg2. Together these findings reveal an instructive role for Fos and Scg2 in establishing a network of Fos-activated neurons via the rewiring of local inhibition from an initially broad to a selectively modulated state. The opposing plasticity mechanisms on distinct inhibitory pathways may support the consolidation of memories over time. Overall design: CaMK2a-Cre; lox-STOP-lox-Rpl22-HA or PV-Cre; lox-STOP-lox-Rpl22-HA mice were intraperitoneally injected with kainic acid (KA) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After 6 hours, hippocampal CA1 tissue was rapidly dissected from mice and subsequently used for isolation of ribosome-bound mRNAs. Immunopurification of ribosome-bound mRNAs was performed as previously described (Sanz PNAS 2009) with 10mM Ribonucleoside Vanadyl Complex present in the lysis buffer and using the mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma HA-7, H3663, 12 ug/IP). A small fraction of lysate before the immunoprecipitation (IP) was used as input for each sample. For CaMK2a-Ribotag, 3 bioreplicates were used per condition, with CA1 tissue from 4 mice pooled per bioreplicate. For PV-Ribotag, 4 bioreplicates were used per condition, with CA1 tissue from 9-10 mice pooled per bioreplicate."

In addition to breast cancer, BCDIN3D may also be linked to metabolism, as its gene locus is associated with obesity and T2D. In order to uncover metabolic pathways regulated by BCDIN3D in cancer, we performed an unbiased analysis of the metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome of breast cancer cells depleted for BCDIN3D. Intersection of these analyses showed that BCDIN3D-depleted cells have increased levels of Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphate (F1,6-BP), the last six-carbon glycolytic intermediate accompanied by reduced glycolytic capacity.

PRJNA665658,Targeting tumor-macrophage interaction via the Notch2-Jag1 axis reverses tumor resistance to paclitaxel,"Taxanes are widely used in chemotherapy, but intrinsic and acquired resistance limit the clinical outcomes. Studies showed tumor interaction with suppressive macrophages plays a key role in taxane resistance, yet therapeutic strategies that deplete or repolarize macrophages are challenging. Here we uncovered a novel tumor-macrophage interaction via Notch2-Jag1 justacrine signaling that can be targeted to sensitize paclitaxel response without affecting the broad macrophage functions. Using translatome profiling, we identified Notch2 upregulation during taxol-induced prolonged mitosis. Notch2 was subsequently activated in the post-mitotic G1 phase by Jag1 expressed on neighboring macrophages, which promoted tumor cell survival by upregulating p38 and anti-apoptotic proteins. Notch2 also upregulated cytokines that further recruited Jag1-expressing macrophages. By targeting this Notch2-Jag1 interaction with a pan-Notch inhibitor, RO4929097, taxol resistance was significantly attenuated in multiple mouse tumor models. Our results point to combining Notch inhibitor with taxane as an effective strategy to selectively disrupt tumor-macrophage interaction underlying chemoresistance. Overall design: For ribosome profiling, HeLa cells were synchronized by double thymidine (2 mM, Sigma). Then the dishes were washed three times with PBS to release the cells in complete DMEM again. 9h later, DMSO and 5nM Taxol were added to each group, respectively. The mitosis cells were collected by shake-off. And the mitosis cells from DMSO and Taxol treatment were defined as mitosis(M) and prolonged mitosis(pM) cells, respectively. Mitotic (M) and prolonged mitotic (pM) HeLa cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol) supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100, 30 U/ml Turbo DNase (Ambion, Life Technologies, CA, United States) and 100 µg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma Aldrich, MO, United States). Ribosome protected fragments were then isolated and sequenced as previously described (PMID: 22056041). The resulting mRNAs were modestly fragmented by partial hydrolysis in bicarbonate buffer so that the average size of fragments was ~80 bp. The fragmented mRNAs were separated by denaturing PAGE and fragments of 26–34 nt were selected. The sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced as previously described (PMID: 22056041).The differential gene translation profile between M and pM were analyzed. The differential gene expression profile between wild type and Notch2 knockdown OVCAR8 cell lines were analyzed. RNA was extracted from OVCAR8 cells using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, total RNA was quantified using a Nano Drop and Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, Shenzhen, China) performed the RNA integrity checking, library preparation and sequencing.Each group was performed in two replicates. Notch2 knockdown OVCAR8 cells were established using plko.1 lentivirus system and two shRNAs target different sequences on Notch2 mRNA were used. Subsequently, we confirmed the RNAseq result in ovarian cancer cells by qPCR (data not included)."
PRJNA665035,Genes with 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine tracts preferentially escape global suppression of translation by the SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 protein,"Viruses rely on the host translation machinery to synthesize their own proteins. Consequently, they have evolved varied mechanisms to co-opt host translation for their survival. SARS-CoV-2 relies on a non-structural protein, NSP1, for shutting down host translation. Despite this, it is currently unknown how viral proteins and host factors critical for viral replication can escape a global shutdown of host translation. Here, using a novel FACS-based assay called MeTAFlow, we report a dose-dependent reduction in both nascent protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in cells expressing NSP1. We perform RNA-Seq and matched ribosome profiling experiments to identify gene-specific changes both at the mRNA expression and translation level. We discover a functionally-coherent subset of human genes preferentially translated in the context of NSP1 expression. These genes include the translation machinery components, RNA binding proteins, and others important for viral pathogenicity. Importantly, we also uncover potential mechanisms of preferential translation through the presence of shared sites for specific RNA binding proteins and a remarkable enrichment for 5' terminal oligo-pyrimidine tracts. Collectively, the present study suggests fine tuning of host gene expression and translation by NSP1 despite its global repressive effect on host protein synthesis.

PRJNA663848,Activation of the antiviral factor RNase L triggers translation of non-coding mRNA sequences,"Ribonuclease L (RNase L) is activated as part of the innate immune response and plays an important role in the clearance of viral infections. When activated, it endonucleolytically cleaves both viral and host RNAs, leading to a global reduction in protein synthesis. However, it remains unknown how widespread RNA decay, and consequent changes in the translatome, promote the elimination of viruses. To study how this altered transcriptome is translated, we assayed the global distribution of ribosomes in RNase L activated human cells with ribosome profiling. We found that RNase L activation leads to a substantial increase in the fraction of translating ribosomes in ORFs internal to coding sequences (iORFs) and ORFs within 5' and 3' UTRs (uORFs and dORFs). Translation of these alternative ORFs was dependent on RNase L's cleavage activity, suggesting that mRNA decay fragments are translated to produce short peptides that may be important for antiviral activity. Overall design: 30 Ribsome profiling datasets on 2-5A or poly I:C treated or untreated A549 lung carcinoma cells."
PRJNA663319,GTPBP1 resolves paused ribosomes to maintain neuronal homeostasis,"Ribosome-associated quality control pathways respond to defects in translational elongation to recycle arrested ribosomes and degrade aberrant polypeptides and mRNAs. Loss of an individual tRNA gene leads to ribosomal pausing that is resolved by the translational GTPase GTPBP2, and in its absence causes neuron death. Here we show that loss of the homologous protein GTPBP1 during tRNA deficiency in the mouse brain also leads to codon-specific ribosome pausing and neurodegeneration, suggesting that these non-redundant translational GTPases function in the same pathway to mitigate ribosome pausing. Ribosome stalling in the mutant brain led to activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) mediated by GCN2 and decreased mTORC1 signaling. However, in contrast to the ISR, which enhanced neuron survival, reduced mTORC1 signaling increased neuronal death. Our data demonstrate that GTPBP1 functions as an important quality control mechanism during translation elongation and suggest that translational signaling pathways intricately interact to regulate neuronal homeostasis during defective translation elongation. Overall design: 18 samples are in analyzed in this study in the context of 3 week old C57BL/6J (B6J) mouse cerebellum. These include 3 replicates of the following genotypes Gtpbp1 -/-, Gtpbp2 -/- (mediated through a previously characterized nmf205 point mutation), and wildtype mice. RNA-seq and ribosome footprint profiling datasets were generated for each sample."
PRJNA661558,Adaptive translational pausing is a hallmark of the cellular response to severe environmental stress,"Adaptation and survival in response to diverse stressors involve reprogramming of mRNA translation. Although the cellular response to mild stress has been intensively studied, the response to severe stress remains unclear. We show here that under severe stress conditions, cells induce transient hibernation-like mechanisms in anticipation of recovery, which we have termed the Adaptive Pausing Response (APR). The APR is a coordinated cellular response that limits ATP supply and consumption processes via severe mitochondrial fragmentation and inhibits mRNA translation initiation by induction of ribosome pausing at translation initiation codons, respectively. During recovery from severe stress, cells exhibited adaptive ISR signaling, which permitted cell cycle progression, resumption of growth, and reversal of mitochondria fragmentation. We propose that the APR preserves vital elements of cellular function in response to severe environmental stress, and likely plays a major role in homeostasis and pathogenesis. Overall design: Cells were treated with the appropriate stressor. Ribo-seq and corresponding RNA-seq experiments were performed."

In particular, the detailed molecular interplays between the AMPK and the mTORC1 pathway in the hepatic benefits of metformin are still ill-defined. Metformin-dependent activation of AMPK classically inhibits mTORC1 via TSC/RHEB. But several lines of evidence suggest additional mechanisms at play in metformin inhibition of mTORC1. Here we investigated the role of direct AMPK-mediated serine phosphorylation of RAPTOR in a new RaptorAA mouse model, in which AMPK phospho-serine sites Ser722 and Ser792 of RAPTOR were mutated to alanine. Metformin treatment of primary hepatocytes and intact murine liver requires AMPK regulation of both RAPTOR and TSC2 to fully inhibit mTORC1, and this regulation is critical for the translational response to metformin.

PRJNA659894,Characterization of PfYTH.2 as an m6A-binding protein in Plasmodium falciparum,"Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is central to the development and replication of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, within its human host. The timely coordination of RNA maturation, homeostasis and protein synthesis relies on the recruitment of specific RNA-binding proteins to their cognate target mRNAs. One possible mediator of such mRNA-protein interactions is the N6-methylation of adenosines (m6A), a prevalent mRNA modification of parasite mRNA transcripts. Here, we used RNA protein pull-downs, RNA modification mass-spectrometry, and quantitative proteomics to identify two YTH-domain proteins (PfYTH.1 and PfYTH.2) as bona fide m6A-binding proteins during parasite blood-stage development. Interaction proteomics revealed that PfYTH.2 associates with the translation machinery, including multiple subunits of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) and poly(A)-binding proteins. Furthermore, knock-sideways coupled with ribosome profiling showed that PfYTH.2 is essential for parasite survival and is a repressor of mRNA translation. Together, these data reveal an important missing link in the m6A-mediated mechanism controlling mRNA translation in a unicellular eukaryotic pathogen."

PRJNA659548,Distinct roles for human mtIF2 and mtIF3 in non-canonical mitochondrial translation.,"The synthesis of mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes is central to cellular metabolism, yet many molecular details of mitochondrial translation remain elusive. It is commonly held view that translation initiation in human mitochondria proceeded in a manner similar to bacterial systems, with the mitoribosomal small subunit bound to the initiation factors, mtIF2 and mtIF3, along with initiator tRNA and an mRNA. However, unlike in bacteria, most human mitochondrial mRNAs lack 5' leader sequences that can mediate small subunit binding, raising the question of how leaderless mRNAs are recognized by mitoribosomes. By using novel in vitro mitochondrial translation initiation assays, alongside biochemical and genetic characterization of cellular knockouts of mitochondrial translation factors, we describe unique features of translation initiation in human mitochondria. We show that in vitro, leaderless mRNA transcripts can be loaded directly onto assembled 55S mitoribosomes, but not onto the mitoribosomal small subunit (28S). In addition, we demonstrate that while mtIF2 is indispensable for mitochondrial translation, mtIF3 activity is not required for translation of leaderless mitochondrial transcripts but is essential for translation of ATP6 in the case of the bicistronic ATP8/ATP6 transcript. Our results confirm important evolutionary divergences of the mitochondrial translation system, and further our understanding of a process central to eukaryotic metabolism.

PRJNA659038,Determine the effects of METTL16 on global translation efficiency via ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq),"METTL16 is a member of methyltransferase like (METTL) family. Unlike well-studied METTL3 and METTL14, we found a much higher percentage of METTL16 is localized in the cytosol. The subcellular distribution holds the ability to potentiate translation efficiency. Via Far-western blotting and Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays, we have identified the direct interactions between METTL16 and eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) a and b. Via cross-linking immunoprecipitation and qPCR (CLIP-qPCR), we have discovered the direct associations between METTL16 and rRNAs. The METTL16-eIF3a/b and METTL16-rRNAs interactions induce the binding between eIF3 and 18S rRNA, promote the formation of 43S preinitiation complex, and eventually expedite translation initiation, the rate-limiting step of translation. To determine the exact effects of METTL16 on translation efficiency, we performed ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) with HEK293T upon CRISPR-Cas9-induced METTL16 knockout. To guarantee the repeatability and avoid any potential off-target effects, we included 3 distint sgRNAs against METTL16. Overall design: The Cas9 single clone of HEK293T cells was infected with lentivirus sgRNAs against METTL16 and the cells were collected at 70-80% confluency after selection with blasticidin and puromycin for at least 1 week. The samples were subjected to ribosome profiling and both the input RNA and footprint RNAs were used for sequencing. Three sgRNAs against METTL16 groups and one sgNS group were included."
PRJNA658965,Upregulation of 5’-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNA translation upon loss of the tumor suppressor ARF,"Tumor cells require nominal increases in protein synthesis in order to maintain high proliferation rates. As such, tumor cells must acquire enhanced ribosome production. How many of the mutations in tumor cells ultimately achieve this aberrant production is largely unknown. The gene encoding ARF is the most commonly deleted gene in human cancer. ARF plays a significant role in regulating ribosomal RNA synthesis and processing, ribosome export into the cytoplasm, and global protein synthesis. Utilizing ribosome profiling, we show that 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNA translation is upregulated following loss of ARF. Genes with increased translational efficiency following loss of ARF include many ribosomal proteins and translation factors.  Knockout of p53 largely phenocopies ARF loss, with increased protein synthesis and expression of 5'-TOP encoded proteins. The 5'-TOP regulators eIF4G1 and LARP1 are upregulated in ARF and p53 null cells. Overall design: RNAseq and Ribosome profiling for three conditions with two replicates for each."
PRJNA658654,Genome-wide structure changes during neuronal differentiation drive gene regulatory networks,"RNAs structures play central roles in various cellular processes, and can be remodeled upon binding to cellular factors such as RNA binding proteins (RBP). However, how widespread this remodeling is and whether structural changes can serve as additional regulatory steps for other regulators remains under-explored. Here, we assayed RNA structural dynamics, gene expression, translation and decay during different stages of human neuronal differentiation to understand the impact of RNA structures in stem cell regulation. RBP binding resulted in wide-spread RNA structure changes during early neuronal differentiation.  Structure changes act as a common mechanism for RBPs to modulate the binding of additional RBPs and miRNAs to coordinate gene expression temporally.  In particular, we showed that PUM2 binding on LIN28A resulted in RNA structure changes that enabled miR-30 binding, leading to downregulation of LIN28A. Compensatory mutagenesis experiments that lock specific structural states confirmed the importance of PUM2-induced structure changes in miR-30 regulation. This systematic study broadens our understanding of RNA structural dynamics during human neuronal differentiation and illustrates the wide-spread and complex role of RBPs in regulating RNA structures for gene regulation during human development. Overall design: High throughput RNA structure probing experiments in vivo using icSHAPE, as well as RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling and RNA decay experiments in hESCs (Day 0, D0), neuronal precursor cells (Day 7, D7), early neurons (Day 8, D8) and neurons (Day 14, D14)."
PRJNA658304,The ribosome collision sensor Hel2 functions as preventive quality control in the secretory pathway,"The ribosome collision due to translational stalling is recognized as a problematic event in translation by E3 ubiquitin ligase Hel2, leading to the non-canonical subunit dissociation followed by targeting of the faulty nascent peptides for degradation. Although Hel2-mediated quality control greatly contributes to maintaining cellular protein homeostasis, its physiological role in dealing with endogenous substrates remains unclear. Here we present a genome-wide analysis, based on selective ribosome profiling, to survey the endogenous substrates for Hel2. This reveals that Hel2 preferentially binds to the pre-engaged secretory ribosome-nascent-chain complexes (RNCs), which is translating upstream of targeting signals. Notably, Hel2 recruitment into secretory RNCs is elevated in the SRP-deficient condition; furthermore, the mitochondrial defects caused by insufficient SRP are enhanced by hel2 deletion, together with the mistargeting of secretory proteins into mitochondria. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the risk management in the secretory pathway for maintaining the cellular protein homeostasis.

Over two-thirds of these micropeptide candidates were experimentally validated in a random test with three micropeptides showing regulatory function in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via modulating the activities of Oxidative phosphorylation, Calcium signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway.Our study provided a genome-wide overview of the translational controls of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and demonstrated an unrecognized role of micropeptides in cardiomyocyte biology.

PRJNA655835,DAP5 enables main ORF translation on mRNAs with structured and uORF-containing 5’ leaders,"Half of mammalian transcripts contain short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that potentially regulate translation of the downstream coding sequence (CDS). The molecular mechanisms governing these events remain poorly understood. Here, we find that the non-canonical initiation factor Death-associated protein 5 (DAP5 or eIF4G2) is required for translation initiation on select transcripts. Using ribosome profiling and luciferase-based reporters coupled with mutational analysis we show that DAP5-dependent translation occurs on messenger RNAs (mRNAs) with long, structure-prone 5' leader sequences and persistent uORF translation. These mRNAs preferentially code for signalling factors such as kinases and phosphatases. We also report that cap/eIF4F- and eIF4A-dependent recruitment of DAP5 to the mRNA facilitates main CDS, but not uORF, translation suggesting a role for DAP5 in translation re-initiation. Our study reveals important mechanistic insights into how a non-canonical translation initiation factor involved in stem cell fate shapes the synthesis of specific signalling factors.

PRJNA655417,Transcriptome-wide analysis of mRNA translation and associated post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms following neuronal membrane depolarisation,"Here, we employed ribosome profiling to explore global changes in mRNA translational status in neuronally differentiated neuroblast cultures at several time-points after whole cell depolarisation, and compared this to steady-state mRNA levels. Immediately after depolarisation, genes with known function at the synapse were subjected to a surge of translational activity without corresponding changes in mRNA levels. At later time-points, however, these changes became synchronised, suggesting there are different layers of post-transcriptional regulation which are temporally separated but become coordinated over time. Sequencing of small RNAs additionally revealed that changes in microRNA (miRNA) and tRNA-derived small RNA fragments (tRFs) coincided with this early post-transcriptional disparity, however these molecules exhibited strongest association with the remodelling of mRNA steady-state levels. Transcripts displaying high levels of translational dynamics relative to underlying mRNA levels were characterised by more intrinsic features, including mRNA length, GC content, secondary structure and motifs for RNA binding proteins. These data suggest that activity-associated neuronal translation is initially regulated independently of mRNA levels, wherein transcript features contribute to modulation of mRNA translatability, while miRNA and tRFs fine-tune mRNA levels. Overall design: Examination of changes in mRNA translation, expression and small RNA expression in neuronally differentiated SH-SY5Y cells."

The overall goal of these experiments was to determine the effects of the m6A methyltransferase complex proteins METTL3 and METTL14 on the expression of interferon stimulated genes. First, we depleted METTL3 and METTL14 in Huh7 cells using siRNAs and treated with Mock or IFN-ß to analyze the regulatory effects of METTL3/14 on interferon-stimulated genes' transcript abundance. We then used Ribo-seq following METTL3/14 siRNA depletion and IFN treatment to quantify its effect on the translation of ISGs and other genes. Overall, we found that METTL3/14 exerts transcript-specific regulatory effects on a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. Overall, METTL3/14 appeared to enhance the translation of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. We characterized the molecular effects of METTL3/14 and m6A on certain ISGs and determined that m6A augments the antiviral effects of the interferon response. Overall design: siRNA transfections were performed for 36 hours in Huh7 cells prior to IFN-ß treatment (50 units/mL) for 8 hours, after which cells were harvested and RNA-seq or Ribo-seq protocols were performed.

PRJNA649751,Extension of mRNA poly(A) tails and 3′UTRs during neuronal differentiation exhibits variable association with post-transcriptional dynamics,"Differentiation of neural progenitor cells into mature neuronal phenotypes relies on extensive temporospatial coordination of mRNA expression to support the development of functional brain circuitry. Cleavage and polyadenylation of mRNA has tremendous regulatory capacity through the alteration of mRNA stability and modulation of microRNA (miRNA) function, however the extent of utilization in neuronal development is currently unclear. Here, we employed poly(A) tail sequencing, mRNA sequencing, ribosome profiling and small RNA sequencing to explore the functional relationship between mRNA abundance, translation, poly(A) tail length, alternative polyadenylation (APA) and miRNA expression in an in vitro model of neuronal differentiation. Differential analysis revealed a strong bias towards poly(A) tail and 3´UTR lengthening during differentiation, both of which were associated with changes in mRNA abundance but not translation. Globally, changes in miRNA expression were predominantly associated with mRNA abundance and translation, however several miRNA-mRNA pairings with potential to regulate poly(A) tail length were identified. Furthermore, 3´UTR lengthening was observed to significantly increase the inclusion of non-conserved miRNA binding sites, potentially enhancing the regulatory capacity of these molecules in mature neuronal cells. Together, our findings suggest poly(A) tail length and APA function as part of a rich post-transcriptional regulatory matrix during neuronal differentiation. Overall design: Examination of changes in mRNA expression, translation, poly(A) tail length, alternative polyadenylation and miRNA expression during neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells."

PRJNA649104,Anatomy of footprint extension in ribosome profiling reveals translational landscape mediated by S1 protein in bacteria,"Ribosome profiling — RNase footprinting of ribosome-bound mRNA — has been a unique and powerful method, applied to widespread organisms to survey ribosome traversal along mRNAs. In contrast to eukaryotes, bacterial ribosome footprints show a broad range of sizes, reflecting the differential states of ribosomes. However, the origin remains unclear. Here, we show that rotated state of ribosomes and intramolecular RNA duplexes each extend bacterial ribosome footprints at the 5' end. Combining elongation inhibitors, cryo-electron microscopy, and ribosome profiling, we demonstrated that the rotated state of ribosomes results in long footprints. Along the subunit rotation, ribosomal protein S1 — a 30S-subunit RNA-binding protein — sterically protects mRNA at the 5' end of the ribosome from RNase digestion and facilitates elongation of the ribosome. Moreover, we found that ribosomes stalled on ycbZ mRNA generate prolonged footprints because of their unique RNA secondary structure proximal to ribosomes. Through the studies of footprint extension, our results revealed S1-mediated stabilization of translation elongation and provide ribosome profiling approach to probe the conformational diversity of ribosomes in bacteria.

PRJNA649003,Ribo-Seq timecourse in RAW264.7 cells upon LPS treatment,"mRNAs are generally assumed to be loaded instantly with ribosomes upon entry into the cytoplasm. To measure ribosome density on nascent mRNA, we developed nascent Ribo-Seq (nRibo-Seq) by combining Ribo-Seq with progressive 4-thiouridine labelling. In mouse macrophages, we experimentally determined, for the first time, the lag between the appearance of nascent RNA and its association with ribosomes, which was calculated to be 20 - 22 min for bulk mRNA, and approximated the time it takes for mRNAs to be fully loaded with ribosomes to be 41 - 44 min. Notably, ribosomal loading time is adapted to gene function as rapid loading was observed with highly regulated genes. The lag and ribosomal loading time correlate positively with ORF size and half-life, and negatively with tRNA adaptation indices. Similar results were obtained in mESCs, where the lag between IN and FP was even more pronounced with 35 - 38 min. We validated our measurements after stimulation of macrophages with lipopolysaccharide, where the lag between cytoplasmic and translated mRNA leads to a corresponding uncoupling between input and ribosome-protected fragments. Uncoupling is stronger for mRNAs with long ORFs or half-lives, a finding we also confirmed at the level of protein production by nascent chain proteomics. As a consequence of the lag in ribosome loading, ribosome density measurements are distorted when performed under conditions where mRNA levels are far from steady state expression, and transcriptional changes affect ribosome density in a passive way. This study uncovers an unexpected and considerable lag in ribosome loading, and provides guidelines for the interpretation of Ribo-Seq data taking passive effects on ribosome density into account.

PRJNA648398,Multiomics analysis couples mRNA turnover and translational control of glutamine metabolism to the differentiation of the activated CD4+ T cell,"The ZFP36 family of RNA-binding proteins acts post-transcriptionally to repress translation and promote RNA decay. Studies of genes and pathways regulated by the ZFP36 family in CD4+ T cells have focussed largely on cytokines, but their impact on metabolic reprogramming and differentiation is unclear. Using CD4+ T cells lacking Zfp36 and Zfp36l1, we combined the quantification of mRNA transcription, stability, abundance and translation with crosslinking immunoprecipitation and metabolic profiling to determine how they regulate T cell metabolism and differentiation. Our results suggest that ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 act directly to limit the expression of genes driving anabolic processes by two distinct routes: by targeting transcription factors and by targeting transcripts encoding rate-limiting enzymes. These enzymes span numerous metabolic pathways including glycolysis, one-carbon metabolism and glutaminolysis. Direct binding and repression of transcripts encoding glutamine transporter SLC38A2 correlated with increased cellular glutamine content in ZFP36/ZFP36L1-deficient T cells. Increased conversion of glutamine to a-ketoglutarate in these cells was consistent with direct binding of ZFP36/ZFP36L1 to Gls (encoding glutaminase) and Glud1 (encoding glutamate dehydrogenase). We propose that ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 as well as glutamine and a-ketoglutarate are limiting factors for the acquisition of the cytotoxic CD4+ T cell fate. Our data implicate ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 in limiting glutamine anaplerosis and differentiation of activated CD4+ T cells, likely mediated by direct binding to transcripts of critical genes that drive these processes. Overall design: mRNA-seq (3 biological replicates), nascent, 4sU-labelled mRNA-seq (2 biological replcates, separated into labelled [nascent RNA], unlabelled [pre-existing RNA] and total fractions) and Ribo-seq (5 biological replicates) were performed in activated CD4+ T cells from control and Zfp36/Zfp36l1 double conditional knockout mice. To identify direct targets of ZFP36-family proteins, iCLIP was performed on activated CD4+ T cells from WT C57BL/6 mice (3 biological replicates), using two independent antibodies that bind to ZFP36L1."
PRJNA648380,Translation and codon usage regulate Argonaute slicer activity to trigger germline small RNA biogenesis [Ribo-Seq],"In Caenorhabditis elegans germline, thousands of mRNAs are concomitantly expressed with antisense 22G-RNAs, which are loaded into the Argonaute CSR-1. Despite their essential functions for animal fertility and embryonic development, how CSR-1 22G-RNAs are produced remain unknown. Here, we show that CSR-1 slicer activity is primarily involved in triggering the synthesis of small RNAs on the coding sequences of germline mRNAs and post-transcriptionally regulates a fraction of targets. CSR-1-cleaved mRNAs prime the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, EGO-1 to synthesize 22G-RNAs concurrently with ribosome translation in the cytoplasm, in contrast to other 22G-RNAs mostly synthesized in germ-granules. Moreover, differences in germline mRNA codon optimality and ribosome occupancy antagonistically affect the abundance of CSR-1 22G-RNAs and the stability of their mRNA targets. We propose that codon usage differences encoded into mRNA sequences might be a conserved strategy adopted in eukaryotes to regulate small RNA biogenesis and Argonaute targeting. Overall design: 14 samples were analyzed by Ribo-seq, including replicates (sample name contains 'rep')."
PRJNA648316,"MazF toxin causes alterations in Staphylococcus aureus transcriptome, translatome and proteome that underlie bacterial dormancy","Bacterial antibiotic resistance is as a serious health problem. Antibiotic resistance appears either because of mutations or as a result of a bacteria dormant state without heritable genetic change. This non-growing state allows bacteria to survive antibiotic treatment. The mechanisms of entrance to the bacterial dormant state are unknown. It has been suggested that toxin-antitoxin systems (TASs) are possible controlling factors for cell dormancy. In Staphylococcus aureus, the role of TASs genome-wide and their link to the dormancy induction mechanisms has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we analyzed the role of MazF toxin on transcriptome, translatome and proteome of S. aureus using RNA-Seq, Ribo-Seq and quantitative proteomics. We characterized the correlation between transcription, translation, and protein levels, and demonstrated that the MazF endonuclease decreases translation directly by cleaving mRNA, and indirectly, by decreasing translation factors and by promoting ribosome hibernation. Thus, MazF represses transcription and translation of many genes rather than a particular set of genes. Nevertheless, several specific pathways affected by MazF were identified: we demonstrated that cell wall thickness is increased and cell division is decreased upon MazF induction. MazF cleaves mRNA in vivo, creating stop-less transcripts and stalled ribosomes. These stalled ribosomes are rescued by SsrA-system, which is activated upon MazF induction. Finally, we described the overall impact of MazF on S. aureus metabolism, and propose one of the mechanisms by which MazF may induce bacterial dormancy. Overall design: Samples in dupicates RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq of WT with pRAB11 vector, ?mazEF with pRAB11, and ?mazEF with pRAB11 vector expressing inducible MazF.

PRJNA648109,Combined analysis of ribo-seq and rna-seq reveals that Mettl3 regulates embryonic cerebral cortex development in mice by controlling the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most important internal messenger RNA (mRNA) modification in mammals. The role of Mettl3, the core component of methyltransferase, and Fto, the demethylase, has not been revealed in the embryonic development of the cerebral cortex in mice. We constructed the conditional knockout of Mettl3 and Fto in the cerebral cortex of mice. We found that Mettl3 deletion causes cell cycle extension of progenitors and massive proliferation of intermediate progenitors at E15.5, which lead to a fold structure of cortex, while Fto deletion hardly altered cell numbers or morphology. Meanwhile, both transcriptome sequence (RNA-Seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) of Mettl3-deleted cortex mRNAs in E15.5 revealed that the differential genes were enriched in cell differentiation, neurogenesis, neuron differentiation, cell proliferation, and cell cycle. Moreover, deleted Mettl3 but not Fto significantly upregulated Ythdf1 and Ythdf2, which caused a substantial change in gene translation efficiency. Our findings indicate cortex m6A represents a novel layer of complexity in gene expression regulation and provide a new mechanism of precisely programmed RNA maturation.

Recent advances in sequencing ribosome protected RNA fragments (Ribo-seq/ ribosome profiling) and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses reveal that many proteins originate from translating non-canonical open reading frames (ORF). The short length and low abundance of non-canonical proteins makes their detection challenging. Here, we leverage the remarkable feature of antigen processing and presentation machinery to sample the (hidden) proteome , by virtue of MHC class I molecules binding and extending the life-span of antigenic peptides, the majority of which derive from defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). We describe a novel proteogenomic approach to identify non-canonical translation products present in whole cell extracts and/or in the immunopeptidome. Our findings demonstrate new features of the non-canonical translatome and their critical contribution to tumor immunosurveillance."

PRJNA646476,Identification of translated small open reading frames in lymphocytes,"Open reading frames (ORFs) are the genomic DNA sequences that have the potential to be translated. Genome annotation pipelines dismiss translation products of small ORFs (smORFs) of less than 100 codons (<300 nucleotides) as being unlikely to have a biological function. In this study, we systematically characterized smORFs in mouse B and T cells under different conditions and predicted a total of 5744 unique actively translated smORFs. We then extended our analysis to ORFs of 101-200 codons in length and predicted 945 of such longer translation products. Additionally, our results have suggested the existence of candidate secreted micropeptides. Furthermore, verifying their existence and identifying their functions will be essential and potentially lead to useful applications. Overall design: Peripheral lymph nodes were isolated from 5 biological replicates of control C57BL/6 mice (Zfp36l1 floxed/floxed without Cre). Each sample was split to generate Ribosome profiling  and total RNA-seq libraries. Ribosome profiling data is submitted here; the corresponding total RNA-seq datasets are available in GSE146073."
PRJNA646470,Global Translational Landscape of the Candida albicans Morphological Transition,"Candida albicans is a major human fungal pathogen that represents the fourth leading cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections in the U.S. and is associated with high mortality and/or morbidity rates in a wide variety of immunocompromised individuals, including cancer and AIDS patients. While the C. albicans morphological transition from yeast to filamentous cells is required for virulence, considerably little is known about translational mechanisms important for controlling this transition as well as other virulence-related processes in C. albicans and other human fungal pathogens. Using ribosome profiling, we report the first global translational profile associated with C. albicans morphogenesis. Strikingly, many genes involved in pathogenesis, filamentation, response to stress and cell wall organization show reduced translational efficiency (TE). Several of these genes are known to be strongly induced at the transcriptional level, suggesting that a translational fine-tuning mechanism is in place. Using a recently developed ORF-calling method, we have identified a significant number of potential uORFs in genes associated with pathogenesis and at least 57 potential novel ORFs, several of which appear to show altered TE in response to filamentation. Finally, using a novel method for global analysis of ribosome pausing from Ribo-seq data, we demonstrate an enrichment of ribosome pausing sites in C. albicans genes associated with protein synthesis and cell wall functions. Altogether, our results suggest that the C. albicans morphological transition is associated with widespread global translational alterations that do not simply reflect transcriptional changes and affect the expression of many genes associated with virulence-related processes and pathogenesis. Overall design: Examination of gene expression by RNA-seq and Ribo-seq in 1 strain of Candida albicans grown under 2 conditions  (YEPD + serum at 37°C (filament-inducing) and YEPD at 30°C (non filament-inducing)). There are three biological replicates for each strain grown under each condition (12 samples total)."
PRJEB38096,Trans control of cardiac mRNA translation in a protein length-dependent fashion - Expression analysis in recombinant inbred (RI) and congenic rat strains by Ribosome- and Polysome-profiling as well as polyA-RNA and total-RNA quantification.,"Little is known about the impact of naturally occurring genetic variation on the rates with which proteins are synthesized by ribosomes. Here, we investigate how genetic influences on mRNA translational efficiency are associated with complex disease phenotypes using a panel of rat recombinant inbred lines. We identify a locus for cardiac hypertrophy that is associated with a translatome-wide and protein length-dependent shift in translational efficiency. This master regulator primarily affects the translation of very short and very long protein-coding sequences, altering the physiological stoichiometric translation rates of sarcomere proteins. Mechanistic dissection of this locus points to altered ribosome assembly, characterized by accumulation of polysome half-mers, changed ribosomal configurations and misregulation of the small nucleolar RNA SNORA48. We postulate that this locus enhances a pre-existing negative correlation between protein length and translation initiation in diseased hearts. Our work shows that a single genomic locus can trigger a complex, translation-driven molecular mechanism that contributes to phenotypic variability between individuals."
PRJNA645135,Ribosome profiling of SMN-primed ribosomes and active ribosome profiling from brains of a mouse model of severe SMA,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality, with an incidence of around 1 in 6,000-10,000 live births. SMA is caused by low levels of full-length survival of motor neuron protein (SMN). We demonstrate that SMN binds to ribosomes and that this interaction is tissue-dependent. We performed ribosome profiling analyses on lysates from P5 wild-type mouse brains exposed to RNase I, from which we isolated SMN-primed ribosomes by immunoprecipitation. SMN-primed ribosomes are preferentially positioned within the first five codons of a set of mRNAs which are enriched for translational enhancer sequences in the 5'UTR and rare codons at the beginning of their coding sequence. These SMN-specific mRNAs are associated with neurogenesis, lipid metabolism, ubiquitination, chromatin regulation and translation. Additionally, we analyzed the positioning of active ribosomes using the Active-RiboSeq method based on RiboLace and compared early symptomatic SMA mouse brains to age-matched controls. We found that loss of SMN induces ribosome depletion, especially at the beginning of the coding sequence of SMN-specific mRNAs, leading to impairment of proteins involved in motor neuron function and stability. Keywords: motor neuron disease, spinal muscular atrophy, SMA, SMN, SMN1, survival of motor neuron, SMN-primed ribosome profiling, translation, RiboLace, Ribo-Seq, active translation, ribosome heterogeneity Overall design: We performed ribosome profiling of SMN-primed ribosomes in brain extracts from control mice at P5 (Smn+/-; SMN2tg/0). Experiments were performed in biological triplicate. In parallel, samples from immunoprecipitation with IgG were used as controls for possible unspecific isolation of ribosome protected fragments. Additionally, we performed active ribosome profiling with RiboLace (PMID: 30355487) and ribosome profiling in SMA early symptomatic mouse brains (Smn-/-; SMN2tg/0). Experiments were performed in biological duplicate. Ribosome profiling of age-matched controls were deposited under accessions GSE102354 (RiboLace) and GSE102318 (ribosome profiling)."

PRJNA644594,Persistent activation of mRNA translation by transient Hsp90 inhibition,"The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone functions as a protein-folding buffer and plays a unique role promoting the evolution of new heritable traits. To better understand how Hsp90 can affect mRNA translation we screened more than 1600 factors involved in mRNA regulation for physical interactions with Hsp90 in human cells. The mRNA binding protein CPEB2 strongly binds Hsp90 via its prion domain. In a yeast model, transient inhibition of Hsp90 resulted in persistent activation of a CPEB translation reporter even in the absence of exogenous CPEB that persisted for 30 generations after the inhibitor was removed. Ribosomal profiling revealed that some endogenous yeast mRNAs, including HAC1, show a persistent change in translation efficiency following transient Hsp90 inhibition. Thus, transient loss of Hsp90 function can promote a non-genetic inheritance of a translational state affecting specific mRNAs, introducing a new mechanism by which Hsp90 can promote phenotypic variation. Overall design: Ribosome-profiling data examining heat shock and Hsp90 inhibition in yeast."

PRJNA643292,GIGYF2 and 4EHP Inhibit Translation Initiation of Defective Messenger RNAs to Assist Ribosome-Associated Quality Control,"Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC) pathways protect cells from toxicity caused by incomplete protein products resulting from translation of damaged or problematic mRNAs. Extensive work in yeast has identified highly conserved mechanisms that lead to the degradation of the faulty mRNA and partially synthesized polypeptide. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9-based screening to search for additional RQC strategies in mammals. We found that failed translation leads to specific inhibition of translation initiation on that message. This negative feedback loop is mediated by two translation inhibitors, GIGYF2 and 4EHP. Both model substrates and growth-based assays established that inhibition of additional rounds of translation acts in concert with known RQC pathways to prevent buildup of toxic proteins. Inability to block translation of faulty mRNAs, and subsequent accumulation of partially synthesized polypeptides, could explain the neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders observed in mice and humans with compromised GIGYF2 function. Overall design: This datasets consists of paired ribosome profiling and RNA-seq datasets collected in replicate after the CRISPRi-mediated knockdown of NEMF, ZNF598, EIF4E2, GIGYF2, and non-targeting negative controls."

Thus, differential inhibition of cancer cells can be achieved by targeting aspects of ribosome biogenesis or ribosome function. Using RiboMeth-seq for profiling of the ~112 2'-O-Me sites in human ribosomal RNA, we demonstrated pronounced hypomethylation at several sites in patient-derived DLBCL cell lines with a more severe perturbation in ABC-DLBCL compared to GBC-DLBCL. We extended our analysis to tumor samples from patients and demonstrated significant changes to the ribosomal modification pattern that appeared to consist of cell growth-related as well as tumor-specific changes. Sites of hypomethylation in patient samples are discussed as potential drug targets, using as an example a site in the small subunit (SSU-C1440) located in a ribosomal substructure that can be linked to DLBCL pathogenesis. Overall design: Cell cultures were analyzed in biological triplicates, tissue and tumor samples in technical triplicates."
PRJNA642123,TRIBE editing reveals specific mRNA targets of eIF4E-BP in Drosophila and in mammals,"4E-BP (eIF4E-BP) represses translation initiation by binding to the 5'cap-binding protein eIF4E and inhibiting its activity. Although 4E-BP has been shown to be important in growth control, stress response, cancer, neuronal activity and mammalian circadian rhythms, it is not understood how it preferentially represses a subset of mRNAs. We successfully used hyperTRIBE (Targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing) to identify in vivo 4E-BP mRNA targets in both Drosophila and mammals under conditions known to activate 4E-BP. The protein associates with specific mRNAs, and ribosome profiling data show that mTOR inhibition changes the translational efficiency of 4E-BP TRIBE targets compared to non-targets. In both systems, these targets have specific motifs and are enriched in translation-related pathways, which correlate well with the known activity of 4E-BP and suggest that it modulates the binding specificity of eIF4E and contributes to mTOR translational specificity. Overall design: We used hyperTRIBE (Targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing) to identify in vivo 4E-BP mRNA targets in both Drosophila S2 cells and human prostate cancer cell PC3 under conditions known to activate 4E-BP. We also carried out ribosome profiling after mTOR inhibition."

PRJNA640641,Ageing-dependent ribosome pausing and nascent polypeptide aggregation,"Increased protein misfolding and aggregation are key hallmarks of ageing and many age-related diseases. As generating and maintaining a functional proteome (proteostasis) is crucial to every cellular process, this age-related decline in proteostasis is suggested to play a primary role in the breakdown of diverse cellular subsystems during ageing. Indeed, augmented proteostasis pathways are associated with extended lifespan across different species. With the ribosome as the earliest proteostasis checkpoint, decreased protein synthesis is also a conserved mechanism that extends lifespan. Yet, it remains unclear whether ageing impacts translation after initiation. Here, we use worms and yeast to investigate how ageing influences translation elongation. We show an age-dependent increase in ribosome pausing at diverse positions in coding sequences. This pausing is conserved in both worms and yeast, particularly at Arg and polybasic regions. We further show that such pausing is associated with the age-dependent aggregation of truncated nascent proteins involved in proteostasis pathways, notably aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. Moreover, we find that impairment in clearing truncated nascent proteins is associated with decreased lifespan. These data establish elongation kinetics and co-translational quality control as critical contributors of the age-related proteostasis collapse, which may precipitate the systemic decline observed during ageing. Overall design: Replicate ribosome profiling libraries were prepared during ageing of worms and yeast, including the long-lived sch9? yeast strain."
PRJNA640006,Genetic circuit characterization by inferring RNA polymerase movement and ribosome usage,"When performing a computation, genetic circuits change states through a symphony of genetic parts that turn regulator expression on and off. Debugging is frustrated by an inability to measure part function and identify the origins of failures. Here, we take “snapshots” of a large genetic circuit in different states. RNA-seq is used to visualize circuit function as a changing pattern of RNA polymerase (RNAP) flux along the DNA. Together with ribosome profiling, all 54 genetic parts are parameterized. The circuit behaves as designed; however, it is riddled with errors, including cryptic sense/antisense promoters and translation, attenuation, incorrect start codons and a failed gate. While serendipitously not impacting function, they reduce prediction accuracy and could lead to failures when used in other designs. Finally, the cellular power (RNAPs and ribosomes) required to maintain a circuit state is calculated. This work demonstrates the use of a small number of measurements to fully parameterize a regulatory circuit and quantify its impact on host.

To address this gap of knowledge, we used the technique of ribosome profiling to study translation in muscle from middle-aged and old individuals. Using ribosome occupancy as a measure of translation status, several mRNAs showed differential translation with age. Older age was associated with lower translation of myosin and titin isoforms and more broadly with the translation of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation encoded by the mitochondrial genome.

PRJNA639161,Parallel global profiling of plant TOR dynamics,"TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) is a deeply conserved protein kinase thatcoordinates eukaryotic metabolism with nutrient availability. In mammals, TORspecifically promotes translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs when amino acids areavailable to support protein synthesis. The mechanisms controlling translationdownstream from TOR remain contested, however, and are largely unexplored inplants. Here, we took parallel global profiling approaches to define the in planta TOR-regulated transcriptome, translatome, proteome, and phosphoproteome. We found thatTOR regulates ribosome biogenesis in plants at multiple levels, but throughmechanisms that do not directly depend on the canonical 5 oligopyrimidine tract motif(5TOP) found in mammalian ribosomal protein mRNAs. To investigate this further, wefocused on a putative TOR substrate identified in our phosphoproteome: LARP1, aeukaryotic RNA-binding protein that is proposed to mediate TOR translational control of5TOP mRNAs in humans and that has gained increased interest because it associateswith SARS-CoV-2. By conducting parallel global profiling experiments with larp1mutants, we discovered that the TOR-LARP1 signaling axis controls 5TOP mRNAtranslation in plants and defined a set of conserved eukaryotic 5TOP mRNAs thatencode cyclins, importins/karyopherins, translation elongation factors, and TCTP1,among others. We then identified novel, plant-specific 5TOP mRNAs involved in criticalbiological processes, including ribosome biogenesis, chromatin remodeling, and auxinsignaling. Our study illuminates the ancestral roles of the TOR-LARP1-5TOP metabolicregulatory network and provides evolutionary context for ongoing debates about themolecular function of LARP1 in eukaryotic cells."

HEK293T cells were treated with 3 different doses of RNase (i.e. low, medium, high) and RNA fragments were isolated for sequencing. 2. Low-input RNase footprinting for 50,000 and 1,000 HEK293T and K562 cells. 3. Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data for HEK293T and K562 cells were used for comparisons."

PRJNA637192,Molecular and functional characterization of melanocyte subpopulations in adult human epidermis based on single-cell RNA sequencing,"Melanocytes are considered cells-of-origin of melanomas. Because heterogeneity within melanocyte subpopulations between developmental lineages (e.g. progenitors or progenies) or anatomical areas (e.g. hairy vs glabrous skin) would be the base of inter-tumor heterogeneity in melanoma subtypes, refined characterization of melanocyte lineages should facilitate understanding development of melanomas.Here we genetically, phenotypically and functionally studied heterogeneity in normal epidermal melanocytes in human hairy (breast) skin utilizing single cell RNA-seq. Four epidermal melanocyte subpopulations were newly determined by single cell molecular profiling. Within them we identified one subpopulation with transcriptomes corresponding to the activated progenitor/precursor melanocytes both in the inter-follicular epidermis and the hair follicle. Interestingly this subpopulation was augmented in tanned than in less tanned areas of the fresh human skin and showed enhanced clonogenicity, ribosome biogenesis and radio-resistance against ultraviolet B (UVB) in vitro, indicating association with melanomagenesis in the context of sun-exposure."
PRJNA637076,Expression of the neuronal tRNA n-Tr20 regulates synaptic transmission and seizure susceptibility,"Loss of the nuclear-encoded brain-specific arginine UCU tRNA, n-Tr20, gene increases seizure threshold in mice, and alters inhibitory neurotransmission in the hippocampus. We investigated the molecular impact of loss of n-Tr20 expression on the trancriptome and translatome in the forebrain and hippocampus of multiple n-Tr20 mutant and control strains. Loss of n-Tr20 altered translation initiation by activating the integrated stress response and suppressing mTOR signaling, the latter of which contributes to the enhanced GABAergic transmission.  Overall design: 33 samples are analyzed in this study from n-Tr20 tRNA knockouts and transgenes in the context of C57BL/6J (B6J) and C57BL6/NJ (B6N) forebrain and hippocampus. The design includes 4 replicates each of forebrain RNA-seq from B6N, B6N-nTr20-/-, B6J-nTr20-/-, B6J, and B6J with the B6N n-Tr20 transgene (B6J-Tg(nTr20N/N) or B6J-Tgwt) mice; one sample was sequenced twice to account for batch effects. Additionally, this study includes hippocampus RNA-seq and ribosome profiling with 3 replicates each from B6N and B6N-nTr20-/- hippocampi."

Our data shows pervasive ribosome pausing in the M. tb translatome. A large number of genes show very high pause immediately downstream to the translation start site. Moreover, serines and alanines in the E site of the ribosome exhibit highest pause scores. Overall design: Ribosome profiling analysis of M. tb grown to log phase, subjected to oxidative stress (50µM cumene hydroperoxide) and pH stress (pH 4.5)."
PRJNA636967,RRF plays critical roles in ribosome homeostasis in E. coli but has little effect on translational coupling,"We used ribosome profiling to characterize the biological role of ribosome recycling factor (RRF) in Escherichia coli. As expected, RRF depletion leads to enrichment of post-termination 70S complexes in 3'-UTRs. We also observe that elongating ribosomes are unable to complete translation because they are blocked by non-recycled ribosomes at stop codons. Previous studies have suggested a role for recycling in translational coupling within operons; if a ribosome remains bound to an mRNA after termination, it may re-initiate downstream. We found, however, that RRF depletion did not significantly affect coupling efficiency in reporter assays or in ribosome density genome-wide. These findings argue that re-initiation is not a major mechanism of translational coupling in E. coli. Finally, RRF depletion has dramatic effects on the activity of ribosome rescue factors tmRNA and ArfA. Our results provide a global view of the effects of the loss of ribosome recycling on protein synthesis in E. coli. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of RRF knock-down condition derived from E. coli MG1655"
PRJNA636959,Authentication of Hippuristanol-eIF4A1 Target Engagement Facilitates Identification of eIF4A1 Helicase Dependencies within 5’ Leader Regions,"Hippuristanol (Hipp) is a natural product that selectively inhibits protein synthesis by targeting eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A, a DEAD-box RNA helicase required for ribosome recruitmentt o mRNA templates. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based variomics screen, we identify functional eIF4A1 Hipp-resistant alleles, which in turn allow us to link the translation-inhibitory and cytotoxic properties of Hipp to eIF4A1 target-engagement. Genome-wide translational profiling in the absence or presence of Hipp (~EC50) were undertaken and our validation studies provided insight into structure-activity relationships of eIF4A-dependent mRNAs. Overall design: Ribosome Profiling and RNA-Sequencing of DMSO and Hippuristanol treated HAP1 cells."
PRJNA635898,"bacTRAP profiling of seven different types of neurons , vulnerable and resistant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) across the lifetime of the mouse","We report here the bacTRAP (bacterial artificial chromosome , translating ribosome affinity purification) profiling of 7 different types of neurons in the mouse, at three different ages: two neuron types very vulnerable to AD (principal cells of entorhinal cortex layer II - ECII), pyramidal cells of hippocampus CA1, and 5 types of neurons more resistant to AD (pyramidal cells of hippocampus CA2 and CA3, granule neurons of the dentate gyrus, pyramidal cells from layer IV of primary visual cortex V1, and pyramidal cells from layer II/III and V of primary somatosensory cortex S1). Using these profiles we generated molecular signatures for each of these cell types, proved that the molecular identity of these cell types is very well conserved across mouse and humans, and constructed functional networks for each cell type that allowed us to identify genes and pathways associated with selective neuronal vulnerability in AD. We also report the profiling of ECII neurons in APP/PS1 mice (a mouse model of Abeta accumulation) at 6 months of age. Overall design: We constructed bacTRAP mice overexpressing eGFP-L10a in a cell-type specific manner. Cell-type specific expression was achieved using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) that contain the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes. For ECII neurons, we used four different lines: two Rasgrp2-bacTRAP lines (using BACs RP23-199D5 and RP24-344N1), two different founder lines for Sh3bgrl2 (using BAC RP23-307B16); for CA1 neurons, two different lines: one SSTR4-bacTRAP (BAC RP23-126C5), and one Cck-bacTRAP line generated previously by the Heintz lab; for CA2 neurons: one Cacng5-bacTRAP line (BAC RP23- 329L1); for CA3 neurons: one Gprin3-bacTRAP line generated previously by the Heintz lab; for dentate gyrus granule neurons: one SSTR4-bacTRAP line (using BAC RP23-126C5, another founder from the one used for CA1, with ectopic expression in DG granule neurons); for V1: one Calca-bacTRAP line (BAC RP23-181A2); for S1: one Cartpt-bacTRAP line (BAC RP24-68J22). We used these mice to immunoprecipitate polysomes from these neurons at 4-5, 12 and 24 months of age, and profiled the isolated mRNA using RNAseq. Additionally, we profiled APP/PS1 mice crossed to ECII-bacTRAP mice (one of the Sh3bgrl2-bacTRAP lines) at 6 months of age to study the effects of Amyloid accumulation on ECII gene expression. In the end we had 3 to 12 replicates for each neuron type at each age. Each replicate consisted in the pooling of 2 different mice. Male mice were used for the profiling in wild-type mice. For the APP/PS1 profiling we used male and female mice."
PRJEB26593,Ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing of human LoVo epithelial cells in response to infection by Listeria monocytogenes,"Host cell gene expression response to a bacterial infection can involve changes at the transcriptional and/or translational levels. To discriminate between these two levels of regulations, we have analyzed the translatome by ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq), and transcriptome by RNA-Seq analysis, of a human epithelial colon adenocarcinoma cell line (LoVo ATCC CCL-229) along a 0- to 10-h time-course of infection by Listeria monocytogenes strain LL195."
PRJNA635625,Elucidating the role of Zuo1 protein on the translational control of gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"The ribosome associated complex (RAC) is a ribosome bound protein chaperone complex reported to surveil the translation of proteins with positively charged regions. It has been posited that RAC might be able to directly regulate translation by coupling co-translational folding with the peptide-elongation cycle. To identify the targets of RAC in cells and test the hypothesis that the complex modulates translation, we performed ribosome profiling on wild- type yeast cells and cells lacking a key component of the RAC that binds near the ribosome active site (zuo1?). Ribosome profiling is a sequencing-based technique that allows us to take a nucleotide resolution snapshot of where every ribosome sits on every mRNA in a cell at a given point in time. This powerful approach can provide information about the contributions of individual proteins to the translational landscape of a cell. We identified >300 targets for the RAC, and unexpectedly observed that the ribosome frameshifts on ~10% of these targets in zuo1? cells. The maintenance of ribosome reading frame is essential for cell health because frameshifts can result in the production of non-functional truncated and extended protein products. These studies have the potential to uncover RAC as a critical determinant of translational fidelity in eukaryotic cells. Overall design: mRNA-seq and Ribosome profiling of exponentially growing (OD600 = 0.6) Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were performed by deep sequencing , in two biological replicates, using Illumina HiSeq-4000 platform."
PRJNA635159,The mammalian cap-specific m6Am RNA methyltransferase PCIF1 regulates transcript levels in mouse tissues,"The 5' end of eukaryotic mRNAs is protected by the m7G-cap structure. The transcription start site nucleotide is ribose methylated (Nm) in many eukaryotes, while an adenosine at this position is further methylated at the N6 position (m6A) by the mammalian Phosphorylated CTD-interacting Factor 1 (PCIF1) to generate m6Am. Here we show that while loss of cap-specific m6Am in mice does not affect viability or fertility, the Pcif1 mutants display reduced body-weight. Transcriptome analyses of mutant mouse tissues support a role for the cap-specific m6Am modification in stabilizing transcripts. In contrast, the Drosophila Pcif1 is catalytically-dead, but like its mammalian counterpart it retains the ability to associate with the Ser5-phosphorylated CTD of RNA pol II. Finally, we show that the Trypanosoma Pcif1 is an m6Am methylase that contributes to the N6,N6,2?-O-trimethyladenosine (m62Am) in the hypermethylated cap4 structure of Trypanosomatids. Thus, PCIF1 has evolved to function in catalytic and non-catalytic roles. Overall design: RNA sequencing was used to identify gene expression differences between Pcif1-/- and Pcif1+/+  in mouse brain, spleen and testes.  To correlate the gene expression changes with loss of m6Am we used m6Am-Exo-Seq method to identify the m6Am transcripts in mouse testes.  Ribosome footprinting in mouse brain was used to search for effects on translation."
PRJNA634994,The mRNA translation landscape in the synaptic neuropil,"To form and modify synaptic connections and store information, neurons continuously remodel their proteomes. The impressive length of dendrites and axons imposes unique logistical challenges to maintain synaptic proteins at locations remote from the transcription source (the nucleus). The discovery of thousands of mRNAs near synapses suggested that neurons overcome distance and gain autonomy by producing proteins locally. It is not known, however if, how and when localized mRNAs are translated into protein. To investigate the translational landscape in neuronal subregions, we performed simultaneous RNA-seq and Ribo-seq from microdissected rodent brain slices to identify and quantify the transcriptome and translatome in cell bodies and the dendrites and axons (neuropil). More than 4800 transcripts were translated in synaptic regions. Thousands of transcripts were found differentially translated between somatic and synaptic regions, with scaffold and signaling molecules mostly arising from local sources. Furthermore, specific mRNA features were identified that regulate the efficiency of mRNA translation. The findings overturn the view that local translation is a minor source of synaptic protein and indicate that on-site translational control is an important mechanism to control synaptic strength."

PRJNA633892,Circuit and molecular architecture of a ventral hippocampal network,"The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is a critical hub in networks that process emotional information.  While recent studies have indicated that vHPC projection neurons are functionally dissociable, the basic principles of how the inputs and outputs of the vHPC are organized remain unclear.  Here we used viral and sequencing approaches to define the logic of the extended vHPC circuit.   Through molecular profiling of vHPC projection neurons, we show that vHPC neurons with distinct projection targets differ in their  transcriptional signatures. Overall design: In this study we determined whether ventral hippocampal (vHPC) neurons that project to one of four target areas, lateral hypothalamus (LH) basomedial amygdala (BMA), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAc), differ in terms of the genes they express.  To do so, we used transcriptional profiling methods that accessed translating mRNAs in ventral hippocampal neurons defined by their projection to one of these four targets.  We labeled ventral hippocampal neurons that projected to ateral hypothalamus (LH) basomedial amygdala (BMA), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAc), in different cohorts of B6.129S4-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(CAG-EGFP/Rpl10a,-birA)Wtp/J (Jackson labs stock #022367) by injection of a retrograde traveling adenoassociated virus expressing Cre recombinase in each of the target areas, then used a translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) approach to profile translation in each of these populations  . RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was then performed to identify differentially enriched mRNAs in the distinct vHPC projection neurons . Each sample correspond to 6 hippocampi from each projection pathway, perfomed in duplicate or triplicate."
PRJNA633162,Vigilin/HDLBP promotes translation of endoplasmic reticulum-targeted mRNAs (A549 HDLBP KO and WT),"The biological role of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in the secretory pathway and their contribution to the recognition and co-translational targeting of ER-localized mRNAs is not well established. In this work we used biochemical, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to delineate the role of human HDLBP/vigilin. PAR-CLIP analysis revealed that HDLBP directly and specifically interacted with more than 80% of all expressed ER-localized mRNAs. Interestingly, the binding to the coding sequence was most prominent for ER-localized mRNAs, while cytosolic mRNAs showed higher binding in the 3'UTR. HDLBP crosslinked strongly to long CU-rich motifs that resided more frequently in coding sequences of ER-localized but not in cytosolic mRNAs. This indicated that the primary sequence composition determines the basis for HDLBP binding specificity and its multivalent interactions with ER-bound mRNAs. PAR-CLIP analysis also revealed direct interactions of HDLBP with the RNA components of the translational apparatus, while in vivo proximity proteomics detected proteins involved in translation and components of the signal recognition particle (SRP). Functional studies using CRISPR-Cas9 HDLBP knockout cell lines in combination with ribosome profiling, pSILAC, and luciferase assays showed decreased translation efficiency of HDLBP target mRNAs, impaired protein synthesis and secretion in the knockout conditions. Finally, HDLBP absence resulted in decrease of in vivo lung tumor formation. These results highlight a general function for HDLBP in the translation of ER -localized mRNAs via the secretory pathway and discover its relevance for cell proliferation and tumor progression. Overall design: RNA-seq of xenograft tumors from A549 HDLBP KO and WT cells."
PRJNA633154,Haploinsufficiency of ribosomal genes limits the viability of monosomic human cells by activation of the p53 pathway,"Chromosome loss that results in monosomy has detrimental consequences for human cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain enigmatic. Using p53 deficient monosomic cell lines, we found that chromosome loss impairs proliferation and genomic stability. Transcriptome and proteome analysis revealed a partial compensation of the gene dosage changes that mitigates the effects of chromosome loss. Monosomy triggers global gene expression changes that differ from the effects of trisomy. Strikingly, ribosome biogenesis and translation were commonly downregulated in monosomic cells. Polysome profiling and translation analysis suggest that the defects arise due to haploinsufficiency of ribosomal genes. The ensuing ribosome biogenesis stress triggers the p53 pathway and G1 arrest when TP53 is reintroduced into monosomic cells. Accordingly, impaired ribosome biogenesis and p53 inactivation are associated with monosomy in cancer. Our first systematic study of monosomy in human cells demonstrates that haploinsufficiency of ribosomal genes presents a dominant negative phenotype of monosomy. Overall design: Transcriptome of human monosomic cell lines"
PRJNA633140,eIF4A2 targets developmental potency and histone H3.3 transcripts for translational control of embryonic and cancer stemness [Ribo-seq],"Stemness is a defining feature in embryonic and cancer stem cells. How stemness is regulated at the mRNA translational initiation remains undefined. We carried out an RNAi screen for key translation initiation factors that maintain the stemness in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We identified eIF4A2 and defined its mechanistic action through Rps26-depleted and -containing ribosomes in translational initiation activation of mRNAs encoding pluripotency factors and H3.3 for embryonic and extraembryonic lineage repression, respectively. eIF4A2 also mediates translation initiation activation of Ddx6, which acts together with eIF4A2 to restrict the totipotent 2-cell (2C) transcription program in ESCs through Zscan4 mRNA degradation and translation repression. Knockdown of eIF4A2 disrupts ESC proteome causing the loss of stemness in ESCs as well as in human glioblastomas where eIF4A2 is highly enriched. Collectively, our study establishes an eIF4A2-mediated translation initiation control of stemness and provides insight into cancer therapeutics targeting the translation initiation machinery. Overall design: eIF4A2 ribosome profiling was investigated via Ribo-seq analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells."
PRJNA633125,MYSM1 maintains ribosomal protein gene expression in hematopoietic stem cells to prevent hematopoietic dysfunction II.,"MYSM1 is a transcriptional regulator essential for HSC function and hematopoiesis. We established that HSC dysfunction in Mysm1-deficiency is driven by p53 stress response, however, the molecular function of MYSM1 as a transcriptional activator and its essential role in p53 stress response repression remain difficult to reconcile. Here, we performed genome-wide analyses of MYSM1-regulated genes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). This included RNA-Seq of sorted Mysm1-deficient mouse HSCs and MPPs, and ChIP-Seq mapping of MYSM1 DNA-binding sites in hematopoietic progenitor cell lines. We demonstrate a direct role for MYSM1 in the regulation of genes encoding protein components of the ribosome (RP-genes) and other regulators of translation. Mechanistically, the dysregulation of RP-genes in Mysm1-deficiency was upstream of p53-activation and associated with reduced HSCs protein synthesis rates and p53-dependent anemia. Overall design: We performed RNA-Seq transcriptional profiling of FACS-sorted primary HSC, MPP1, and MPP2 cells. Briefly, bone marrow cells were harvested from Mysm1 fl/fl CreERT2 mice following tamoxifen-induced Mysm1-deletion, and from tamoxifen-treated Mysm1 fl/+ CreERT2 and corn-oil vehicle-treated Mysm1 fl animals. The cells were sorted using FACS into primary HSC, MPP1, and MPP2 cells, gating on Lin-cKit+Sca1+CD150+Flt3-, and CD34-CD48- for HSCs, CD34+CD48- for MPP1, and CD34+CD48+ for MPP2 cells. RNA was isolated from the FACS-sorted cells using the MagMAX total RNA kit (Ambion, Life Technologies), and quality assessed using Bioanalyzer RNA Pico chips (Agilent). rRNA depletion and library preparation were performed using the SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq kit (Takara Clontech). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer in paired-end 50bp configuration. Cells from multiple mice were pooled to achieve yields of >1ng of RNA per sample, and three independent samples were analyzed per genotype for each cell-type for tamoxifen-induced mice and two independent samples for vehicle-treated mice."
PRJNA633124,Repression of p53-target gene Bbc3/puma by MYSM1 is essential for the survival of hematopoietic multipotent progenitors and contributes to stem cell maintenance,"MYSM1 is a transcriptional regulator essential for HSC function and hematopoiesis. We established that p53 activation is a common mechanism mediating HSC dysfunction, MPP depletion, and lymphopenia in Mysm1-deficiency, however, the specific p53-induced effectors that trigger dysfunction in Mysm1-deficient HSPCs remain unknown. Here, we performed RNA-Seq of Lin-cKit+Sca1+CD150+ and CD150- HSPCs from Mysm1-/-Puma-/-, Mysm1-/-Puma+/-, Puma-/-, and wild-type mice; (Mysm1-/-Puma+/- phenocopies Mysm1-/-). We showed that Bbc3/PUMA is the primary non-redundant mediator of MPP depletion in Mysm1-deficiency and contributes to HSC dysfunction, whereas depletion of lymphoid-lineage cells involves PUMA-independent p53 activities. We also identified a broad downregulation of genes encoding protein components of the ribosome (RP-genes) and other regulators of translation in Mysm1-deficiency, and the downregulation persisted in Mysm1-/-Puma-/-. Overall design: We performed RNA-Seq transcriptional profiling of FACS-sorted primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Briefly, bone marrow cells were harvested from Mysm1-/-Puma-/-, Mysm1-/-Puma+/-, Puma-/-, and wild-type mice; (Mysm1-/-Puma+/- phenocopies Mysm1-/-), and sorted using FACS into primary HSPCs, gating on Lin-cKit+Sca1+CD150+ and CD150-. RNA was isolated from the FACS-sorted cells using the MagMAX total RNA kit (Ambion, Life Technologies), and quality assessed using Bioanalyzer RNA Pico chips (Agilent). RNA (10 ng) was rRNA-depleted and used for library preparation with the SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq kit (Takara Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) designed for low input. The RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer in a paired-end 50-bp configuration."

PRJNA632042,Effect of QTRT2 KO  on mitochondrial translation,"Mitochondria are organelles that generate most of the energy in eukaryotic cells in the form of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryote. Twenty-two species of mitochondrial (mt-)tRNAs encoded in mtDNA are required to translate essential subunits of the respiratory chain complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. mt-tRNAs contain post-transcriptional modifications introduced by nuclear-encoded tRNA-modifying enzymes. These modifications are required for deciphering genetic code accurately, as well as stabilizing tRNA. Loss of tRNA modifications frequently results in severe pathological consequences. We performed a comprehensive analysis of post-transcriptional modifications of all human mt-tRNAs, including 14 previously-uncharacterized species, and revised the modification status of some of the previously studied species. In total, we found 17 kinds of RNA modifications at 137 positions (8.7% in 1,575 nucleobases) in 22 species of human mt-tRNAs. An up-to-date list of 34 genes responsible for human mt-tRNA modifications are provided. We here demonstrated that both QTRT1 and QTRT2 are required for biogenesis of queuosine (Q) at position 34 of four mt-tRNAs. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the mitochondrial decoding system, and could help to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of human mitochondrial diseases caused by aberrant tRNA modifications.

PRJNA631930,Translation initiation site profiling reveals widespread synthesis of non-AUG-initiated protein isoforms in yeast,"Genomic analyses in budding yeast have helped to define the foundational principles of eukaryotic gene expression, but have systematically excluded specific classes of potential coding regions, including those with non-AUG start codons. Without methods to define coding regions empirically, the prevalence of these non-canonical coding regions has been impossible to assess. Here, we applied an experimental approach to globally annotate translation initiation sites in yeast and identified a class of 149 genes that encode N-terminally extended alternate protein isoforms that result from translation initiation at non-AUG codons upstream of the annotated AUG start codon. These alternate isoforms are produced in concert with canonical isoforms and are translated with a high degree of specificity, resulting from initiation at only a small subset of possible start codons in 5' leader regions. Their translation is enriched during meiosis, and is induced by low eIF5A levels, which are observed in this context. These findings reveal widespread production of non-canonical protein isoforms and, more generally, show unexpected complexity to the rules by which the budding yeast genome is decoded. Overall design: We performed ribosome profiling following pre-treatment of budding yeast cells with 3 micromolar of the translation initiation inhibitor, lactimidomycin (LTM)."
PRJNA630973,Genome-wide effects of the antimicrobial peptide apidaecin on translation termination,"The proline-rich antimicrobial peptide apidaecin (Api) inhibits bacterial protein synthesis in a distinctive way. In vitro biochemical and structural studies showed that Api binds in the nascent peptide exit tunnel of a ribosome that has completed translation of a gene and traps the release factors on the ribosome. By analyzing the distribution of ribosomes on mRNAs in Api-treated cells using Ribo-seq, we uncovered a range of effects that stem from the unique mechanism of Api action. Exposure of bacterial cells to Api results in arrest of ribosomes at stop codons, likely in a post-release state due to direct Api action, as well as in a pre-release state due to the depletion of available release factors. In addition, Api action leads to a pronounced queuing of translating ribosomes behind those arrested at stop codons. One of the major consequences of Api action is a dramatically increased level of stop codon bypass by ribosomes paused in a pre-release state, leading to an accumulation of proteins with C-terminal extensions, as confirmed by whole-cell proteomics analysis. Stop codon bypass occurs either in 0-frame, by misincorporation of a near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA at the stop codon, or via frameshifting, allowing for a fraction of the translating ribosomes to reach the 3' ends of mRNA transcripts. The pervasive stalling of pre-release ribosomes at the stop codons and at the RNA transcripts ends triggers activation of the cellular ribosome rescue systems which, likely due to Api action as well, remain ineffective. Understanding the unique mode of Api action as translation termination inhibitor in the cell can advance the development of treatments for infection and genetic diseases as well as new research tools for genome exploration. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq were performed on Escherichia coli dosed with apidaecin and compared to non-treated cells (2 biological replicates each). Additionally, the lysate of one Api replicate and one control replicate were treated with the antibiotic puromycin in an attempt to clear ribosomes from the mRNAs."
PRJNA630716,Decoding SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity,"SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the SARS-CoV-2 trascriptome was reported recently, its coding capacity and the relative production of different viral proteins remained unclear. Utilizing a suit of ribosome profiling techniques, we present a high resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions. Overall design: To capture the SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity, we applied a suits of ribosome profiling approaches to two types of infected cells, Vero 6 and Calu 3. The Vero 6 cells were infected for 5 and 24 hours with BavPat1/2020 EPI_ISL_406862, and the Calu 3 cells were infected for 7 hours with BavPat1/2020 Ref-SKU: 026V-03883. For each time point we mapped genome-wide translation events by preparing three different ribosome-profiling libraries. Two libraries facilitate mapping of translation initiation sites, by treating cells with lactimidomycin (LTM) or harringtonine (Harr), drugs that inhibit translation initiation, and the third library was prepared from cells treated with the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). In parallel, we used a tailored RNA-seq protocol which on top of quantification of RNA levels allows identification of transcription start sites (TSSs)."
PRJNA630709,Ribosome Footprinting (RiboSeq) analysis of mRNA translation in MEF Wt cells overexpressing  METTL1+WDR4,"The RNA methyltransferase METTL1 catalyzes the N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification of certain tRNAs, mRNAs, and miRNA precursors. However, the role of METTL1 and its cofactor WDR4 in cancer remains largely unexplored. Here we reveal the oncogenic role of METTL1/WDR4. METTL1 is frequently amplified and overexpressed in cancers and correlates with poor patient survival. METTL1 depletion in human cancer cells causes decreased abundance of m7G-modified tRNAs, altered cell cycle, and inhibits oncogenicity. Strikingly, METTL1/WDR4 overexpression induces oncogenic transformation and carcinogenesis. Mechanistically, we find increased abundance of a subset of m7G-modified tRNAs including tRNA-Arg(TCT), and increased translation of mRNAs enriched in the corresponding AGA codon including cell cycle regulators. Accordingly, expression of tRNA-Arg(TCT) is significantly elevated in many cancer types, correlates with patient survival, and overexpression of this tRNA enhances reporter gene expression and cell transformation. Thus, METTL1/WDR4-mediated m7G tRNA modification drives oncogenic transformation, thereby highlighting METTL1 as a promising cancer therapeutic target. Overall design: Examination of translatome in MEF Wt cells overexpressing METTL1+WDR4 compared to empty vector control, in duplicate, using Ribo-Seq  techique."

PRJNA627881,4EHP and GIGYF1/2 induce translation-coupled messenger RNA decay [Wildtype and ZNF598-null],"Although canonical mRNA degradation is generally recognized to be translation dependent, our understanding of the molecular events that coordinate ribosome movement with the decay machinery is still limited. Here, we show that the 4EHP–GIGYF1/2 complex triggers co-translational mRNA decay as a result of altered ribosome activity during elongation. Human cells lacking 4EHP and GIGYF1 and 2 proteins accumulate transcripts known to be degraded in a translation dependent manner or with prominent ribosome pausing. These include mRNAs encoding secretory and membrane-bound proteins or specific tubulin isotypes, among others. 4EHP–GIGYF1/2 fails to reduce target mRNA levels in the absence of ribosome stalling or upon disruption of its interaction with the cap structure, DDX6 and a GYF domain-associated protein. Our studies reveal how a repressor complex linked to neurological disorders minimizes the protein output of a subset of mRNAs.

PRJNA627130,Selectivity of mRNA degradation by autophagy in yeast,"Synthesis and degradation of cellular constituents must be balanced to maintain cellular homeostasis, especially during adaptation to environmental stress. The role of autophagy in the degradation of proteins and organelles is well-characterized. However, autophagy-mediated RNA degradation in response to stress and the potential preference of specific RNAs to undergo autophagy-mediated degradation have not been examined. In this study, we demonstrate selective mRNA degradation by rapamycin-induced autophagy in yeast. Profiling of mRNAs from the vacuole reveals that subsets of mRNAs, such as those encoding amino acid biosynthesis and ribosomal proteins, are preferentially delivered to the vacuole by autophagy for degradation. We also reveal that autophagy-mediated mRNA degradation is tightly coupled with translation by ribosomes. Genome-wide ribosome profiling suggested a high correspondence between ribosome association and targeting to the vacuole. We propose that autophagy-mediated mRNA degradation is a unique and previously-unappreciated function of autophagy that affords post-transcriptional gene regulation.

PRJNA626635,Regulation of translation by site-specific ribosomal RNA methylation [RNA-Seq],"We report that 2'-O-methylation levels at subset of positions in human ribosomal RNA are variable between cell types and conditions, and that the degree of methylation at distinct sites is responsive to key cellular pathways. MYC overexpression results in increased methylation at a particular rRNA site (18S:C174). We find that this methylation is important for modulating translation of distinct mRNAs, leading to phenotypic changes including modulation of cell proliferation rate. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of HelaS3 and HelaS3-SNORD45C knockout cells. HelaS3 cells have rRNA 18S:Cm174 methylation whereas HelaS3-SNORD45C knockout cells cells do not have 18S:Cm174 methylation.

PRJNA625261,Dual targeting of DDX3 and eIF4A by the translation inhibitor rocaglamide A,"Small molecule compounds that sense the nucleic acid sequences, promise the attractive venue for drug development. Such an unusual effect has been observed in the natural product Rocaglamide A (RocA) from Aglaia plant, proving to exhibit anti-tumor effects by clamping eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A onto mRNA polypurine sequences. Although eIF4A has been speculated the unique target of RocA, the insensitization of eIF4A in human cells only partially rescued the translation repression from RocA, suggesting another alternative target of this compound. Here, we revealed that DDX3 is an alternative target of RocA. Developing a RocA derivative with an O-nitrobenzoxadiazole unit (RocA-O-NBD), which can covalently bind to proximate proteins and provide fluorescence to them, we identified DDX3 bound to RocA. As observed in eIF4A, RocA locked the DDX3 protein onto polypurine sequences of RNA in an ATP-independent manner. De novo assembled Aglaia plant transcriptome uncovered the natural amino acid substitutions in Aglaia DDX3 to protect itself from RocA toxicity. Because of the dominant negative effect of RocA, we also proved the protein abundance of eIF4A and DDX3 in cancer cells determines their sensitivity to RocA. Overall, this study discovered DDX3 as another target of RocA and suggests the probability to predict tumor toxicity of RocA by the target abundance. Overall design: Ribosome profiling"
PRJNA624906,Ythdf m6A readers compensate each other in a context dependent manner [Ribo-seq],"YTH domain family proteins Ythdf1, Ythdf2, Ythdf3 are three readers with highly similar structure, which were shown to have different roles in the cell. However, their similarity and the fact that they tend to bind the same targets suggest that in some cases they may have an overlapping role. In this paper, we systematically knocked-out (KO) each of the three readers and the three together (triple-KO), and estimated the effect in-vitro in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and in-vivo, in viability and gametogenesis. We show that in mESCs there is a compensation between the three readers, with a dramatic hyper-pluripotent phenotype only in the triple-KO. However, in-vivo, Ythdf2 has a dominant role that cannot be compensated by Ythdf1 or Ythdf3, both in viability of the mouse pups and in gametogenesis. We suggest that compensation is dosage-dependent, and in-vivo we cannot detect it due to difference in the readers' expression, both in level and in spatial location. In addition, we found that Ythdf1 and Ythdf3 specifically down-regulate 2-cell genes, that Ythdf2-KO in gametogenesis affects microtubuline related genes, and that Mettl3-KO severity is increased as the deletion occurs earlier in gametogenesis. Overall design: Mouse embryonic stem cells were knocked-out to each of the following proteins: Mettl3, Ythdf1, Ythdf2, Ythdf3, and Ythdf1/2/3 triple-KO. Ribosome footprint (ribo-seq) was generated in each of these KOs, and in WT control."

In this work we used biochemical, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to delineate the role of human HDLBP/vigilin. PAR-CLIP analysis revealed that HDLBP directly and specifically interacted with more than 80% of all expressed ER-localized mRNAs. Interestingly, the binding to the coding sequence was most prominent for ER-localized mRNAs, while cytosolic mRNAs showed higher binding in the 3'UTR. HDLBP crosslinked strongly to long CU-rich motifs that resided more frequently in coding sequences of ER-localized but not in cytosolic mRNAs. This indicated that the primary sequence composition determines the basis for HDLBP binding specificity and its multivalent interactions with ER-bound mRNAs. PAR-CLIP analysis also revealed direct interactions of HDLBP with the RNA components of the translational apparatus, while in vivo proximity proteomics detected proteins involved in translation and components of the signal recognition particle (SRP). Functional studies using CRISPR-Cas9 HDLBP knockout cell lines in combination with ribosome profiling, pSILAC, and luciferase assays showed decreased translation efficiency of HDLBP target mRNAs, impaired protein synthesis and secretion in the knockout conditions. Finally, HDLBP absence resulted in decrease of in vivo lung tumor formation.

PRJNA623585,HUMAN-VIRUS CHIMERIC PROTEINS GENERATED DURING INFECTION,"RNA viruses are a major threat to global human health. The life cycles of many highly pathogenic RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) and Lassa virus depends on host mRNA, as viral polymerases cleave 5'm7G-capped host transcripts to prime viral mRNA synthesis ('cap-snatching'). We hypothesized that start codons within cap-snatched host transcripts could drive the expression of chimeric human-viral coding sequences. Here, we report the existence of this mechanism of gene origination ('start-snatching'), which creates, depending on the translatability of the viral UTRs, human-virus protein chimeras either as N-terminally extended viral proteins or entirely novel polypeptides by genetic overprinting.  We show that both types of chimeric proteins are made in IAV-infected cells, can generate T cell responses and contribute to virulence. Our results indicate that IAV, and likely a multitude of other human-, animal- and plant-viruses, use this host-dependent mechanism to expand their proteome diversity during infection.

PRJNA623564,Maternal Immune Activation Disrupts Proteostasis in the Fetal Brain,"Maternal infection and inflammation during pregnancy is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring, but little is understood about the molecular mechanisms underlying this epidemiologic phenomenon. We leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing to profile transcriptional changes in the rodent fetal brain in response to maternal immune activation (MIA) and identified perturbations in cellular pathways associated with mRNA translation, ribosome biogenesis, and stress signaling. We found that MIA specifically activated the integrated stress response (ISR) in male, but not female, MIA offspring, thereby reducing global mRNA translation and altering nascent proteome synthesis. Moreover, genetic blockade of ISR activation rescued the social behavior phenotype in MIA male offspring. Our data suggest that therapeutic targeting of the ISR may be beneficial in reducing maternal inflammation-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall design: Two timepoints (E14 and E18), each with two bioreplicates of the following: PBS control male, PBS control female, maternal immune activation male, maternal immune activation female.

PRJNA622261,N1-methyladenosine methylations in tRNA drive liver tumorigenesis by PPARδ-mediated cholesterol synthesis,"Increased protein translation plays a critical role in cancer development and treatment1,2. However, the molecular mechanism that is involved in this process remains poorly understood. N1-methyladenosine (m1A) methylation in RNA accounts for regulating mRNA translation in a post-transcriptional manner3,4. Here we show that m1A methylation levels are remarkably elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient tumor tissues, especially in patients with microscopic vascular invasion (MVI). Moreover, m1A methylation signals are increased in liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) and are negatively correlated with HCC patient survival. Consistently, TRMT6 and TRMT61A, forming m1A methyltransferase complex, are highly expressed in advanced HCC tumors and are negatively correlated with HCC survival. TRMT6/TRMT61A-mediated m1A methylations are required for self-renewal of liver CSCs and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, TRMT6/TRMT61A-dependent m1A in tRNA boost PPARd expression, which triggers cholesterol synthesis to activate Hedgehog signaling, driving self-renewal of liver CSCs and tumorigenesis. For potential therapeutic benefit, we further identify a specific inhibitor against TRMT6/TRMT61A complex that exerts effective therapeutic effect on liver cancer with high m1A methylations. Our findings provide novel insights into the function and molecular mechanism of m1A modifications underlying liver tumorigenesis and drug target, which will serve as a new biomarker for HCC and pave a new way to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for HCC patients. Overall design: We find that the overall m1A methylation signal as well as the relevant m1A-methyltransferase TRMT6/61A are of abberrently high level in HCC tumor samples. By performing m1A sequencing for small RNA populations, we discovered several tRNAs with elevated m1A58 methylation stoicheometry. Then we evaluate the influenences on gene expression via Ribo-seq, and proved that TRMT6/TRMT61A-dependent m1A in tRNA boost expression of some metabolic pathway genes, which trigger cholesterol synthesis to activate Hedgehog signaling, driving self-renewal of liver CSCs and tumorigenesis."

Results: We found to adapt to long heat exposure, the expression of many genes is modulated in a coordinated manner at a transcriptional and translational level. However, a significant group of genes opposes this trend and shows mainly translational regulation. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of retinal transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue.

PRJEB33323,Deconstructing the individual steps of vertebrate translation initiation,"In eukaryotes, the number of ribosomes synthesizing a given protein depends on how many are recruited to its mRNA, their success in navigating its 5' untranslated region (UTR) and whether they recognize its start codon. Initiation of translation is a rate limiting step in protein synthesis and key to gene expression control 1, but despite this centrality it remains poorly understood 2,3. Here we introduce ribosome complex profiling (RCP-seq) to capture the transcriptome-wide occupancy of scanning, initiating, elongating and terminating ribosome complexes in a higher eukaryote. We track scanning and elongating ribosomes across all 5' UTRs in zebrafish, which enable us to assess the individual regulatory contributions from the three stages of initiation: ribosome recruitment, scanning of the 5' UTR and recognition of the start codon. Our data sheds light on small subunit recruitment to mRNAs presenting evidence for the threading model and demonstrates that sequence features regulate this recruitment. We estimate the processivity of scanning ribosomes as they traverse the 5' UTR and show that the repressive effects of upstream open reading frames depend on the efficiency of both translation initiation and termination. Finally, we determine the optimal initiation contexts by directly estimating the conversion of scanning to elongating ribosomes and demonstrate specific regulation of translation initiation at the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results open for the possibility of deconvoluting translation initiation into separate stages and provides the first view of global occupancy of ribosomal small subunits in a vertebrate."

Thus, dynamic changes in gene expression in response to the cellular status, not only at the transcriptional but also translational levels should be elucidated as a direct reflection of the protein level, rapid downstream response, and cellular energy cost. In this study, RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling were performed for five industrially important Streptomyces species at different growth phases, which are the deep sequencing of total mRNA and only mRNA fragments protected by translating ribosomes, respectively.

An essential part of this technology is removal of unwanted, normally abundant, ribosomal RNA sequences in order to save on sequencing costs. The most effective commercial solution (Ribo-Zero) has been discontinued and a number of new, experimentally distinct commercial applications have emerged on the market. Here we evaluated several commercially available alternatives designed for RNA-seq of human samples and find them unsuitable for ribosome footprint profiling. We instead recommend the use of custom-designed biotinylated oligos, which were widely used in early ribosome profiling studies. Importantly, we warn that depletion solutions based on targeted nuclease cleavage significantly perturb the high-resolution information that can be derived from the data, and thus do not recommend their use for any applications that require precise determination of the ends of RNA fragments.

PRJNA609216,Germline inherited small RNAs facilitate the clearance of untranslated maternal mRNAs in C. elegans embryos (Ribo-Seq),"Inheritance and clearance of maternal mRNAs are two of the most critical events required for animal early embryonic development. However, the mechanisms regulating this process are still largely unknown. Here, we show that together with maternal mRNAs, C. elegans embryos inherit a complementary pool of small non-coding RNAs that facilitate the cleavage and removal of hundreds of maternal mRNAs. These antisense small RNAs are loaded into the maternal catalytically-active Argonaute CSR-1 and cleave complementary mRNAs no longer engaged in translation in somatic blastomeres. Induced depletion of CSR-1 specifically during embryonic development leads to embryonic lethality in a slicer-dependent manner and impairs the degradation of CSR-1 embryonic mRNA targets. Given the conservation of Argonaute catalytic activity, we propose that a similar mechanism operates to clear maternal mRNAs during the maternal-to-zygotic transition across species. Overall design: 7 samples were analyzed by Ribo-seq, including replicates (sample name contains 'rep')."

PRJNA608916,Microbes modulate sympathetic neurons via a gut-brain circuit,"Gut-brain connections monitor the intestinal tissue and its microbial and dietary content1, regulating both intestinal physiological functions such as nutrient absorption and motility2,3, and brain–wired feeding behaviour2. It is therefore plausible that circuits exist to detect gut microbes and relay this information to central nervous system (CNS) areas that, in turn, regulate gut physiology4. We characterized the influence of the microbiota on enteric–associated neurons (EAN) by combining gnotobiotic mouse models with transcriptomics, circuit–tracing methods, and functional manipulation. We found that the gut microbiome modulates gut–extrinsic sympathetic neurons; while microbiota depletion led to increased cFos expression, colonization of germ-free mice with short-chain fatty acid–producing bacteria suppressed cFos expression in the gut sympathetic ganglia. Chemogenetic manipulations, translational profiling, and anterograde tracing identified a subset of distal intestine-projecting vagal neurons positioned to play an afferent role in microbiota–mediated modulation of gut sympathetic neurons. Retrograde polysynaptic neuronal tracing from the intestinal wall identified brainstem sensory nuclei activated during microbial depletion, as well as efferent sympathetic premotor glutamatergic neurons that regulate gastrointestinal transit. These results reveal microbiota–dependent control of gut extrinsic sympathetic activation through a gut-brain circuit.

PRJNA608705,40S ribosome profiling reveals distinct roles for Tma20/Tma22 (MCT-1/DENR) and Tma64 (eIF2D) in 40S subunit recycling,"The recycling of ribosomes at stop codons for use in further rounds of translation is critical for efficient protein synthesis. Removal of the 60S subunit is catalyzed by the ATPase Rli1 (ABCE1) while removal of the 40S is thought to require Tma64 (eIF2D), Tma20 (MCT-1), and Tma22 (DENR). However, it remains unclear how these Tma proteins cause 40S removal and control reinitiation of downstream translation. Here we developed an enhanced 40S ribosome footprinting strategy to directly observe intermediate steps of ribosome recycling in cells. Deletion of the genes encoding these Tma proteins resulted in broad accumulation of unrecycled 40S subunits at stop codons, directly establishing their role in 40S recycling. Furthermore, the Tma20/Tma22 heterodimer was responsible for a majority of 40S recycling events while Tma64 played a minor role. Introduction of an autism-associated mutation into TMA22 resulted in a loss of 40S recycling activity, linking ribosome recycling and neurological disease. Overall design: 40S ribosome profiling of 12 biological samples with 11 replicates. 80S ribosome profiling of 4 biological samples with one replicate.

PRJNA608263,Alterations in the transcriptome and translatome profiles of Arabidopsis pollen germinated under heat stress,"Plant reproduction is one key biological process very sensitive to heat stress and, as a consequence, enhanced global warming imposes serious threats to sustain food safety worldwide. In this work we have focused on the molecular impact that high temperature conditions impose on gene expression of Arabidopsis pollen germinated in vitro. We have used a high-resolution ribosome profiling technology to provide, for the first time, a comprehensive study of how both the transcriptome and the translatome of germinated pollen respond to the increase in temperature. Although heat shock responses operate properly under high temperature conditions, we have uncovered important alterations under elevated temperature regimes down-regulating essential processes linked to cation/proton exchange and to carbohydrate/cation symport transport. These alterations provide molecular explanations to the dramatic alterations of pollen tube growth under heat stress. Overall a high correlation between transcriptional and translational responses to high temperature was found, but specific regulations at the translational level are also present in pollen subjected to temperature challenging conditions. Overall design: Riboprofiling analysis was performed for Arabidopsis thaliana in vitro germinated pollen at permissive and restrictive temperatures (24°C 35°C respectively)."
PRJNA607999,Genome-wide survey of ribosome collision [eif5A siRNA],"In protein synthesis, ribosome movement is not always smooth, rather often impeded by numerous reasons. Although the deceleration of ribosome defines the fates of the mRNAs and the synthesizing proteins, fundamental questions remain to be addressed including where ribosomes pause in mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid context causes the pausing, and how physiologically significant the slowdown of protein synthesis is. Here we surveyed the position of ribosome collisions, caused by ribosome pausing, at a genome-wide level using the modified ribosome profiling in human and zebrafish. The collided ribosomes, i.e. disome, emerge at various sites; the proline-proline-lysine motif, stop codons, and 3' UTR. The number of ribosomes in a collision is not limited to two, rather four to five, forming a queue of ribosomes. Especially, XBP1, a key modulator of unfolded protein response, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes thus acts as a substrate for ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to avoid the accumulation of undesired proteins in the absence of stress. Our results provide an insight into the causes and the consequences of ribosome slowdowns by dissecting the specific architecture of ribosomes. Overall design: Ribosome profiling"

PRJNA607266,High resolution ribosome profiling reveals gene-specific details of UGA recoding in selenoprotein biosynthesis,"SECIS binding protein 2 (SECISBP2) increases the efficiency of recoding of UGA codons as selenocysteine (Sec) during translation of mRNAs containing a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in the 3'-untranslated region. Using ribosomal profiling, we have previously studied selenoprotein translation in hepatocyte-specific Secisbp2-deficient mouse liver and neuron-specific Secisbp2-mutant mouse brain. The use of organs carries the limitation of cellular heterogeneity with cells still expressing wild-type SECISBP2 that might potentially confound analyses and conclusions. To address this concern, we studied a haploid human HAP1 cell line carrying a non-functional SECISBP2 protein. These cells are still capable of metabolically incorporating 75Se into selenoproteins. We performed ribosomal profiling, and show that the efficiency of UGA recoding is gene-specific in SECISBP2- deficient cells. Analysis of ribosomes with UGA either at the A-site or the P-site revealed in a transcript-specific manner that SECISBP2 helps to recruit tRNASec and stabilizes mRNA. We propose a new measure to assess UGA/Sec read-through at codon resolution in all selenoproteins, i.e. the proportion of ribosomes carrying UGA in the P-site, pUGA. An additional, new observation is frame- shifting occurring after the UGA/Sec codon in GPX1, SELENOF, and SELENOW in HAP1 cells, a finding corroborated by reanalysis of neuron-specific Secisbp2-mutant brains. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and 3'-mRNA-sequencing of HAP1 Cell samples from 2 SECISBP2 KO replicates and 2 WT replicates"

PRJNA605796,Decoding mRNA translatability and stability from 5’ UTR,"Precise control of protein synthesis by engineering sequence elements in 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) remains a fundamental challenge. To accelerate our understanding of cis-regulatory code embedded in 5'UTR, we devised massively parallel reporter assays from a synthetic mRNA library composed of over one million 5'UTR variants. A completely randomized 10-nucleotide sequence preceding an upstream open reading frame (uORF) and downstream GFP leads to a broad range of mRNA translatability and stability in mammalian cells. While efficient translation protects mRNA from degradation, uORF translation triggers mRNA decay in a UPF1-dependent manner. We also identified translational inhibitory elements in 5'UTR with G-quadruplex as a mark for mRNA decay in the P-body. Unexpectedly, an unstructured A-rich element in 5'UTR, while enabling cap-independent translation, destabilizes mRNAs in the absence of translation. Our results not only expose diverse sequence features of 5'UTR in controlling mRNA translatability, but also reveal ribosome-dependent and -independent mRNA surveillance pathways. Overall design: To accelerate our understanding of cis-regulatory code embedded in 5'UTR of mRNA, we devised a high-throughput uORF reporter assay from a synthetic mRNA library composed of over one million 5'UTR variants. This reporter assay is compatible with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and polysome profiling."

PRJNA605444,Male-specific lymphomagenesis by serial inverse dysregulation of the RNA helicases DDX3X and DDX3Y.,"DDX3X is a ubiquitously expressed RNA helicase involved in multiple stages of RNA biogenesis. DDX3X is frequently mutated in Burkitt lymphoma but the functional basis for this is unknown. Here, we show that loss-of-function DDX3X mutations are also commonly found in MYC-translocated diffuse large B cell lymphoma and reveal functional co-operation between mutant DDX3X and MYC. We show that DDX3X promotes translation of mRNAs encoding components of the core translational machinery, thereby driving global protein synthesis. Loss-of-function DDX3X mutations moderate MYC-driven global protein synthesis, thereby buffering MYC-induced proteotoxic stress during early lymphomagenesis. Established lymphoma cells subsequently restore full protein synthetic capacity by ectopic expression of DDX3Y, a Y-chromosome homologue that is normally expressed exclusively in testis. These findings highlight the vulnerability of MYC-driven lymphoma to proteotoxic stress and identify an unexpected male-specific mechanism of carcinogenesis, namely the commandeering of a testis-specific Y-chromosome gene to drive full malignant transformation. Overall design: Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq sequencing data in 2 lymphoma cell lines Mutu and U2392 following DDX3X shRNA knockdown at 2 time points: 24h and 48h; RNA-Seq sequencing data comparing DDX3X R475C knockin versus control edited cell line clones"

PRJNA605114,4EHP and GIGYF1/2 induce translation-coupled messenger RNA decay,"Although canonical mRNA degradation is generally recognized to be translation dependent, our understanding of the molecular events that coordinate ribosome movement with the decay machinery is still limited. Here, we show that the 4EHP–GIGYF1/2 complex triggers co-translational mRNA decay as a result of altered ribosome activity during elongation. Human cells lacking 4EHP and GIGYF1 and 2 proteins accumulate transcripts known to be degraded in a translation dependent manner or with prominent ribosome pausing. These include mRNAs encoding secretory and membrane-bound proteins or specific tubulin isotypes, among others. 4EHP–GIGYF1/2 fails to reduce target mRNA levels in the absence of ribosome stalling or upon disruption of its interaction with the cap structure, DDX6 and a GYF domain-associated protein. Our studies reveal how a repressor complex linked to neurological disorders minimizes the protein output of a subset of mRNAs.

PRJNA604580,The role of long noncoding RNAs during pancreas development,"LncRNAs are developmentally regulated and highly cell type-specific non-coding RNAs that have emerged as important regulators of cell fate commitment and maintenance. In this study, we dissected the role of lncRNAs in human pancreas development by classifying lncRNAs based on their dynamic regulation, subcellular localization, and engagement with ribosomes during the stepwise differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) towards pancreatic fate. We then deleted 10 candidate lncRNAs in hESCs and characterized the knockout phenotypes of pancreatic developmental intermediates, prioritizing dynamically regulated lncRNAs with validated translation potential and proximity to developmental TFs. This small-scale loss-of-function screen revealed that most lncRNAs are dispensable for pancreatic development and the regulation of nearby genes. We identify LINC00261 as the first translated lncRNA involved in human endocrine cell development, and show that it regulates gene expression in pancreatic progenitor cells in trans rather than cis. Through systematic dissection of LINC00261's coding and noncoding functions, we can exclude a role for the produced micropeptides in this process. Instead, we posit that, over the course of pancreatic differentiation, the biological activity of multiple lncRNAs is controlled by a regulatory, translation machinery dependent mechanism that employs ribosome engagement and short open reading frame translation to dose lncRNA activity in the nucleus. It is conceivable that inadequate nuclear LINC00261 dosage during human pancreas development could predispose individuals to developing diabetes. Overall design: RNA-seq and Ribo-seq analysis of H1 embryonic stem cells differentiated towards the pancreatic endocrine cell fate."

We report that absence of Mettl5 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) results in a changes gene expression, decrease in translation rate, spontaneous loss of pluripotency and compromised differentiation potential. Mice lacking METTL5 recapitulate symptoms of patients with METTL5 mutations, thereby providing a new mouse disease model.

PRJNA603124,The Ccr4-Not complex monitors the translating ribosome for codon optimality,"Control of messenger RNA (mRNA) decay rate is intimately connected to translation elongation, but the spatial coordination of these events is poorly understood. The Ccr4-Not complex initiates mRNA decay through deadenylation and activation of decapping. We used a combination of cryo–electron microscopy, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays to examine the recruitment of Ccr4-Not to the ribosome via specific interaction of the Not5 subunit with the ribosomal E-site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This interaction occurred when the ribosome lacked accommodated A-site transfer RNA, indicative of low codon optimality. Loss of the interaction resulted in the inability of the mRNA degradation machinery to sense codon optimality. Our findings elucidate a physical link between the Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome and provide mechanistic insight into the coupling of decoding efficiency with mRNA stability. Overall design: 2 replicates in 2 different strains."
PRJNA602917,Ribosome profiling of ABCE1-knockout cells,"Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a pathway that degrades messenger RNAs containing premature termination codons. Here, a genome-wide screen for NMD factors uncovered an unexpected mechanism that broadly governs 3' untranslated region (UTR)-directed regulation. The screen revealed that NMD requires lysosomal acidification, which allows transferrin-mediated iron uptake, which in turn is necessary for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. This pathway converges on the Fe-S cluster-containing ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, whose impaired function results in the movement of ribosomes into 3' UTRs where they displace exon junction complexes, thereby abrogating NMD. Importantly, these effects extend beyond NMD substrates, with ABCE1 activity required to maintain the accessibility of 3' UTRs to diverse regulators, including microRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Due to the sensitivity of the Fe-S cluster of ABCE1 to iron availability and reactive oxygen species, these findings reveal an unanticipated vulnerability of 3' UTR-directed regulation to lysosomal dysfunction, iron deficiency, and oxidative stress. Overall design: Method: Ribosome profiling was performed in HCT116 cells that received, via lentivirus, Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting either ABCE1 or non-targeting control sgRNAs. Two sgRNAs were used for each condition, and thus 4 biological samples were used for these experiments."
PRJNA602876,Use of NanoLuc-Based Reporters that Monitor Nonsense Suppression and Inhibition of Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay to Identify Potent New Agents That Partially Reverse the Effects of Nonsense Mutations,"Premature termination codons (PTCs) lead to loss of protein function by 1) ending mRNA translation before a full-length protein is made, and 2) by triggering nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a pathway that targets a PTC-containing mRNA for degradation. Nonsense suppression therapy aims to restore protein function by suppressing termination at PTCs (called readthrough, or RT). However, the efficiency of current readthrough agents is generally quite low. We reasoned that by stimulating both readthrough and increasing mRNA levels, greater protein function can be restored than with readthrough alone. In this study, we developed a series of novel NanoLuc reporters designed to identify and differentiate compounds that induce readthrough, enhance mRNA abundance (by NMD inhibition or other mechanisms), or target both mechanisms simultaneously (referred to as dual RT/NMD reporters). We show that treatments that promote readthrough and NMD inhibition led to synergistic increases in NanoLuc activity of the RT/NMD reporter over either condition alone. We then used a dual RT/NMD reporter to carry out a high throughput screen of a library of 771,345 compounds. We identified 180 compounds with the ability to increase NanoLuc activity in our dual RT/NMD reporter assay. To confirm that such synergy can also amplify protein function in a disease model, we treated cells expressing a CFTR-Y122X mini-intron construct with one hit from this screen, SRI-37240. We found that this compound produced a much larger increase in CFTR activity compared to either the RT compound G418 +/- the NMD inhibitor amlexanox, and the activity obtained could be further enhanced with CFTR modulators. These results confirm the utility of these new reporters to identify many potent new molecules that counteract the effects of nonsense mutations.

PRJNA602676,The zinc finger domains in U2AF26 and U2AF35 have diverse functionalities including a role in controlling translation,"Recent work has associated point mutations in both zinc fingers (ZnF) of the spliceosome component U2AF35 with malignant transformation. However, surprisingly little is known about the functionality of the U2AF35 ZnF domains in general. Here we have analyzed key functionalities of the ZnF domains of mammalian U2AF35 and its paralog U2AF26. Both ZnFs are required for splicing regulation, whereas only ZnF2 controls protein stability and contributes to the interaction with U2AF65. These features are confirmed in a naturally occurring splice variant of U2AF26 lacking ZnF2, that is strongly induced upon activation of primary mouse T cells and localized in the cytoplasm. Using Ribo-Seq in a model T cell line we provide evidence for a role of U2AF26 in activating cytoplasmic steps in gene expression, notably translation. Consistently, an MS2 tethering assay shows that cytoplasmic U2AF26/35 increase translation when localized to the 5'UTR of a model mRNA. This regulation is partially dependent on ZnF1 thus providing a connection between a core splicing factor, the ZnF domains and the regulation of translation. Altogether, our work reveals unexpected functions of U2AF26/35 and their ZnF domains, thereby contributing to a better understanding of their role and regulation in mammalian cells. Overall design: EL4 cells, either control or stabely overexpressing a U2af26 variant localizing to the cytoplasm, were investigated via ribosome profiling. In parallel total RNA was sequenced to normalize for changes in gene expression levels."
PRJNA602407,A PRC2-independent function for EZH2 in regulating rRNA 2′-O methylation and IRES-dependent translation,"Overactivated ribosome biogenesis is a common feature of cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we report enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase, could interact with fibrillarin (FBL) directly in the nucleolus. While loss of EZH2 does not impact FBL-mediated histone H2AQ104 methylation (H2AQ104me) and 18S rRNA processing, EZH2 is proved to be involved in rRNA 2'-O methylation in a manner dependent of its interaction with FBL. Mechanistically, EZH2 strengthens the fibrillarin (FBL)-NOP56 interaction by binding to both proteins and thus facilitates the assembly of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (box C/D snoRNP). Strikingly, EZH2 deficiency alters translational efficiency and reduces internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity of key oncogenes in prostate cancer. In summary, our findings reveal a novel non-methyltransferase role of EZH2 that mediates FBL functions, which may provide more options for the development of EZH2-targeting curative strategies in cancer.

Studying the physiological and translational dynamic mechanism of rice yield recovery after abrupt drought-flood alternation has great potential benefits for production application. The main reason for the yield recovery of nitrogen (N) supply after abrupt drought-flood alternation (T1_N) was the increase in effective panicle per plant. N application is achieved by regulating the physiological and biochemical processes such as endogenous hormone balance, N metabolism enzymes, antioxidant enzyme activities, photosynthesis, osmotic adjustment substances, dry matter accumulation and transport, and N absorption and utilization to achieve rapid growth recovery effect after abrupt drought-flood alternation stress in rice. Using ribosome profiling combined with RNA-seq sequencing technology, analysis of the interaction between transcription and translation of N supply recovery after abrupt drought-flood alternation has shown that a small proportion of response genes (14.0% of up-regulated genes and 6.6% of down-regulated genes) were shared between transcription and translation level, which revealed the independence of N supply recovery transcription and translation response after abrupt drought-flood alternation. Further analysis shows that the translation efficiency (TE) of the gene is greatly influenced by its sequence characteristics, including GC content, coding sequence length and normalized minimum free energy. Genome-wide analysis found that 7003 genes contained upstream open reading frames (uORFs). compared with untranslated uORFs, the increased number of translated uORFs promoted the improvement of TE. The TE of uORF in T1_N is lower than that TE of uORF in T1 on a genome-wide basis. This study defines the genome-wide translation regulation pattern of N supply after abrupt drought-flood alternation stress, which is helpful to understand the highly dynamic translation mechanism of rice and provides insights for future field production and breeding."

We also show that alterations in translation efficiencies across mRNAs in FXS mouse cortices exhibit a positive to negative gradation with coding sequence length, which is prevented by the genetic reduction of S6K1. Our findings reveal the identity of dysregulated mRNAs and a molecular mechanism by which reduction of S6K1 prevents altered translation in FXS. Overall design: Examination of genome-wide translational state in wild-type, Fmr1-deficient, Rps6kb1-deficient, and double knockout (Fmr1 and Rps6kb1 deficient) mouse cortices via next-generation sequencing-based profiling of transcription and translation."
PRJNA601135,Deregulation of ribosomal protein expression and translation promotes breast cancer metastasis [ribo-Seq BRx142],"We conducted an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR activation screen to identify genes that accelerate distal metastasis by breast cancer patient-derived circulating tumor cells (CTCs) following direct intravascular inoculation in mice. Regulators of translation and ribosomal proteins were prominent among these, and expression of RPL15, a component of the large ribosome subunit, was sufficient to increase metastatic growth in multiple organs. RPL15 overexpression selectively increases translation of other ribosomal proteins and cell cycle regulators. Unsupervised analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing of freshly-isolated CTCs from breast cancer patients identifies a subset with strong ribosomal and protein translation signatures, correlated with increased proliferative markers, epithelial markers and poor clinical outcome. Thus, ribosome protein expression identifies an aggressive subset of CTCs, whose therapeutic targeting may suppress metastatic progression. Overall design: We performed ribosomal profiling in control and RPL15 overexpressing circulating tumor cell-derived cell lines to determine the global ribosome occupancy of mRNA transcripts, identify changes in translational preference, and calculate the translational efficiency for any given transcript (i.e., the ratio of ribosome-bound mRNA to all polyA-mRNA). One control specimen and one RPL15 overexpressing specimen was profiled in each of two batches."

PRJNA600412,Co-existence of compulsory and plastic rRNA 2'-O-Methylation sites in human breast tumours,"Emerging evidence suggests that changes in ribosomal RNA 2'O-ribose methylation (rRNA 2'OMe) in the human ribosome play a key role in regulating translation thereby contributing in setting particular phenotypes such as hallmarks of cancer cells. Here, by analysing the rRNA 2'OMe in a large series of 195 human primary breast tumours using the RiboMETH-seq approach  we have identified the positions within the rRNA molecules which can tolerate the absence of 2'OMe in humans. The frequency of rRNA 2'OMe at some positions is highly stable between individuals (termed “stable”) whereas it can vary substantially at other positions (termed “variant”). Differential association of rRNA 2'OMe with breast cancer features, evolution and structure/function characteristics suggest the stable positions showing a low inter-variability might be required to maintain the core structure and thus the function of the ribosome – representing compulsory rRNA 2'OMe positions. In contrast, the variant positions displaying high inter-variability might be the source of regulatory events – representing plastic rRNA 2'OMe positions. Therefore our data issued from rRNA 2'OMe profiling of a large-scale human sample series bring the first compelling evidence to resolve two divergent long lasting visions of the role of rRNA 2'O-Me and sustain the emerging role of the ribosome plasticity in regulating translation in cancer. Overall design: rRNA 2'OMe profiling in a series of 195 primary breast tumours"
PRJNA600267,Virus-induced codon-specific reprogramming to favor viral RNA translation,"How viruses, such as the emerging mosquito-borne Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), express their genomes at high levels despite an enrichment in suboptimal codons remains a puzzling question. By integrating subcellular fractionation and transcriptome-wide analyses of translation in CHIKV-infected human cells, we demonstrate an unanticipated virus-induced reprogramming of the host translation machinery to favor translation of viral RNA over cellular genes featuring optimal codon usage. This reprogramming was specifically apparent at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the preferred translation compartment of CHIKV RNA, and it is mediated by the wobble uridine 34 tRNA modification enzyme KIAA1456 whose expression is enhanced upon viral infection. Since KIAA1456 itself is encoded by a CHIKV-like codon usage, infection triggers a positive feed-back loop that ensures efficient virus protein production. Our findings demonstrate an unprecedented interplay of viruses with the host tRNA epitranscriptome to favor viral protein expression. Overall design: HEK 293T cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation after being infected with Chikungunya virus for 12 h (MOI=40), while control cells were mock infected for 12 h. Both subcellular compartments were then subjected to RNA-seq and Ribo-seq to identify differentially translated mRNAs. All experiments were performed at least in triplicates."

PRJNA599422,Thousands of novel unannotated proteins expand the MHC I immunopeptidome in cancer,"Tumor epitopes – peptides that are presented on surface-bound MHC I proteins - provide targets for cancer immunotherapy and have been identified extensively in the annotated protein-coding regions of the genome. Motivated by the recent discovery of translated novel unannotated open reading frames (nuORFs) using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we hypothesized that cancer-associated processes could generate nuORFs that can serve as a new source of tumor antigens that harbor somatic mutations or show tumor-specific expression. To identify cancer-specific nuORFs, we generated Ribo-seq profiles for 29 malignant and healthy samples. These included primary normal and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells, patient-derived primary glioblastoma (GBM) and melanoma cell cultures, primary healthy melanocytes, as well as established colon carcinoma and melanoma cell lines. These also included B721.221 cells, the parental cell line previously used to generate 92 single HLA allele-expressing lines from which we collected mono-allelic MHC I immunopeptidome data. We developed a hierarchical approach to identify translated novel unannotated open reading frames that leverages the large amount of Ribo-seq data we have generated in order to uncover lowly expressed nuORFs, while also preserving tissue specificity. We  constructed a database of novel unannotated ORFs (nuORFdb) and used it to analyze mass spectrometry datasets of MHC I-bound peptides, where we detected peptides from 3,555 nuORFs. Additionally, we used nuORFdb to identify cancer-specific nuORFs, as well as nuORFs harboring cancer-specific somatic variants as potential sources of neoantigens in cancer. *This repository contains data from the publicly available cell lines used in this study, including B721.221 cells, A375 cells, HCT116 cells and primary healthy melanocytes (Thermo C0025C).

PRJNA598557,Anti-tumor immunity induces the presentation of aberrant peptides in melanoma,"Extensive tumor inflammation, reflected by high levels of infiltrating T-cells and Interferon gamma (IFN?) signaling, is thought to improve checkpoint immunotherapy response. However, many tumors escape by activating multiple cellular pathways that induce immunosuppression. One pivotal immune-suppressive mechanism is the production of Tryptophan metabolites along the kynurenine pathway by IFN?-induced IDO1 enzyme production. However, phase III clinical trials using chemical inhibition of IDO1 in combination with PD1 pathway blockade failed to improve melanoma treatment, suggesting incomplete understanding of the role of IDO1 and the consequent Tryptophan degradation on mRNA translation and cancer progression. Here, we investigated the effects of prolonged IFN? treatment on mRNA translation in melanoma cells by ribosome profiling. Our results suggest that IFN?-induced IDO1-mediated Tryptophan depletion may play a key role in the immune recognition of melanoma cells, by inducing the production and presentation of aberrant peptides. Overall design: RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and mass spectrometry to measure mRNA levels, mRNA translation, and protein levels."
PRJNA598453,A novel mechanism of bacteria to adapt to nutrient deprivation via the ribosome silencing factor RsfS (reference number: NMICROBIOL-19112987),"The factor RsfS is present in almost all bacteria and organelles. RsfS is important under conditions of nutrient downshifts leading to decreasing growth rates. A common feature of these conditions is a strong reduction of the translation capacity revealed by polysomal fraction decrease and a vast appearance of vacant 70S ribosomes, which might cause a devastating energy drain by stimulating the activity of GTPase proteins e.g. EF-G with idle ribosomes. Here we show that RsfS blocks association of free ribosomal subunits and induces dissociation exclusively of vacant ribosomes rather than of programmed ribosomes carrying tRNAs. As a consequence, RsfS reduces the abundance of the cellular translational apparatus, and the EF-G dependent burst of GTP cleavage in the presence of vacant 70S ribosomes as well as with 30S and 50S subunits is decreased. These observations hint to a regulatory role of RsfS by utilizing cellular resource in an economic way under conditions, where the amino acids are limited and energy has to be saved.

PRJNA597326,Sulfur-dependent translational regulation via methylation multiplicity of 18S rRNA,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a conserved nucleoside modification that regulates many facets of RNA metabolism and cellular physiology. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we find that the universally conserved tandem adenosines at the 3' end of 18S rRNA (A1781 and A1782 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which were thought to be constitutively di-methylated (i.e. N6, N6-dimethyladenosine or m62A), are also mono-methylated (i.e. m6A). Although present at substoichiometric amounts, m6A at these positions increases significantly and specifically in response to sulfur starvation in both yeast and mammalian cells. Combining yeast genetics and ribosome-profiling, we further demonstrate that ribosomes bearing different numbers of methyl groups (zero, one, and two) at these tandem adenosines exhibit distinct translation profiles in a sulfur-dependent fashion. Our work thus reveals methylation multiplicity as a mechanism to regulate translation and also uncovers the functional importance of the ubiquitous m62A modification in 18S rRNA. Overall design: We performed ribosome profiling and RNA-seq on three Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains growing with and without methionine"
PRJNA594956,Insights into the global effect on Staphylococcus aureus growth arrest by induction of the endoribonuclease MazF toxin,"A crucial bacterial strategy to avoid killing by antibiotics is to enter a growth arrested state, yet the molecular mechanisms behind this process remain elusive. The conditional overexpression of MazF, the endoribonuclease toxin of the MazEF toxin-antitoxin system in Staphylococcus aureus, is one approach to induce bacterial growth arrest, but its targets remain largely unknown. We used overexpression of MazF and high-throughput sequence analysis following the exact mapping of non-phosphorylated transcriptome ends (nEMOTE) technique to reveal in vivo toxin cleavage sites on a global scale. We obtained a catalogue of MazF cleavage sites and unearthed an extended MazF cleavage specificity that goes beyond the previously reported one. We correlated transcript cleavage and abundance in a global transcriptomic profiling during mazF overexpression. We observed that MazF affects RNA molecules involved in ribosome biogenesis, cell wall synthesis, cell division and RNA turover and thus deliver a plausible explanation for how mazF overexpression induces stasis. We hypothesize that autoregulation of MazF occurs by directly modulating the MazEF operon, such as the rsbUVW genes that regulate the alternative SigB, including an observed cleavage site on the MazF mRNA that would ultimately play a role in entry and exit from bacterial stasis. Overall design: mazF is a toxin with an endoribonuceolitic activity. To study mazF in S. aureus, we build the strain dmazEF where the toxin (mazF) and its antitoxin (mazE) are deleted. We introduced into it a plasmid (pF) with mazF under the control of anhydrotetracycline inducible promoter. At OD 0.4, and after 10 minutes induction of mazF, the RNA is extracted and prepared folowing two protocols: RNA-seq and nEMOTE-seq. While RNA-seq allow to obtain a global picture of the expressed RNA fragments in the cell, nEMOTE-seq focus specifically on mono-phosphorylated 5'-ends. As the endoribonucleic activity of mazF is expected to create new monoposphorylated 5'-ends when an RNA is cleaved, nEMOTE-seq is used to find cleavage sites of mazF by looking at 5'-ends specifically appearing when mazF is expressed."

PRJNA594648,Translational regulation in response to boron in Arabidopsis thaliana,"We previously reported that ribosome stalling at AUG-stop sequences in the 5'-UTR plays a critical role in regulating the expression of Arabidopsis thaliana NIP5;1, which encodes a boron uptake transporter, in response to boron conditions in media. Here, we conducted ribosome profiling analysis to reveal the genome-wide regulation of translation in response to boron conditions in A. thaliana. We identified 460 translationally regulated genes. Transcripts with reduced translation efficiency were rich in upstream open reading frames (uORFs), highlighting the importance of uORF-mediated translational regulation. We found that 148 uORF instances had greater ribosome density under high boron conditions. Moreover, translationally downregulated transcripts were rich in minimum uORFs (AUG-stops), suggesting that AUG-stops play a global role in the boron response. Boron increased the ribosome occupancy of stop codons, indicating that this element is involved in global translational termination processes.

PRJNA594022,Autism-misregulated eIF4G microexons control synaptic translation and higher-order cognitive functions [Ribo-Seq],"Microexons represent the most highly conserved class of alternative splicing, yet their functions are poorly understood. Here, we focus on closely related neuronal microexons overlapping prion-like domains in the translation initiation factors, eIF4G1 and eIF4G3, the splicing of which is activity-dependent and frequently disrupted in autism. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of these microexons selectively up-regulates synaptic proteins that control neuronal activity and plasticity and further triggers a gene expression program mirroring that of activated neurons. Mice lacking the Eif4g1 microexon display social behavior, learning and memory deficits, as well as alterations in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. The eIF4G microexons appear to reduce synaptic protein synthesis by causing ribosome stalling, through a mechanism whereby they promote the coalescence of cytoplasmic granule components associated with translation repression, including the Fragile X mental retardation protein, FMRP. The results thus reveal an autism-disrupted mechanism by which alternative splicing specializes translation to control higher-order cognitive functioning. Overall design: Ribo-seq and control RNA-seq in wt and Eif4g1/Eif4g3 double-knockout in vitro-differentiated neurons"
PRJNA593553,ZAK activation on colliding ribosomes triggers SAPK signaling pathways to regulate cell fate,"Problems arising during translation of mRNAs lead to ribosome stalling and collisions with trailing ribosomes. These collisions are known to trigger a series of events including degradation of the stalled nascent polypeptide, decay of the problematic mRNAs, and ribosome rescue. However, the systemic cellular response of ribosome collision has not been explored. Here, we uncover a novel function for ribosome collisions in signal transduction. Using multiple translation elongation inhibitors and cellular stress conditions, we show that ribosome collisions activate both the SAPK (Stress Activated Protein Kinase) and GCN2-mediated cellular stress response pathways that lead to apoptosis and the integrated stress response (ISR), respectively. We further show that the MAPKKK ZAK functions as the sentinel for ribosome collisions, and ZAK is required for activation of both SAPKs p38/JNK and GCN2 signaling pathways. Selective ribosome profiling and biochemistry demonstrate that ZAK preferentially associates with the minimal unit of colliding ribosomes, the disome, inducing ZAK phosphorylation. While ZAK associates with elongating ribosomes under non-stressed conditions, activation of ZAK is specifically trigger by colliding ribosomes. Together, these results provide new insights into how perturbation of translational homeostasis, as read-out by colliding ribosomes, regulates cell fate. Overall design: 4 samples for selective ribosome profiling experiments using ZAK OE HeLa cells. 4 samples for ribosome profiling experiments using HeLa cells."
PRJNA593256,Growth Optimized Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase Levels Prevent Maximal tRNA Charging,"Summary Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) serve a dual role in charging tRNAs. Their enzymatic activities both provide protein synthesis flux and reduce uncharged tRNA levels. Although uncharged tRNAs can negatively impact bacterial growth, substantial concentrations of tRNAs remain deacylated even under nutrient-rich conditions. Here we show that tRNA charging in Bacillus subtilis is not maximized due to optimization of aaRS production during rapid growth, which prioritizes demands in protein synthesis over charging levels. The presence of uncharged tRNAs is alleviated by precisely tuned translation kinetics and the stringent response, both insensitive to aaRS overproduction but sharply responsive to underproduction, allowing for just-enough aaRS production atop a “fitness cliff”. Notably, we find that the stringent response mitigates fitness defects at all aaRS underproduction levels even without external starvation. Thus, adherence to minimal, flux-satisfying protein production drives limited tRNA charging and provides a basis for the sensitivity and setpoints of an integrated growth-control network. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq experiments of Bacillus subtilis strains"
PRJNA591917,Repression of damaged and intact rDNA by the SUMO pathway,"Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are essential components of the ribosome and are among the  most abundant macromolecules in the cell. To ensure high rRNA level, eukaryotic  genomes contain dozens to hundreds of rDNA genes, however, only a fraction of the rRNA  genes seems to be active, while others are transcriptionally silent. In Drosophila rDNA  units damaged by insertions of retrotransposons are repressed by an unknown  mechanism. Here, we established a new model to study regulation of rDNA expression  using molecularly marked rDNA transgenes. Using this model, we show that insertion of  any heterologous sequence into rDNA leads to transcriptional repression. We found that  SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) is required for efficient repression of damaged rDNA  units. Surprisingly, SUMO also controls expression of intact rDNA, demonstrating that a  single pathway is responsible for both selective repression of damaged units and silencing  of surplus rDNA.

PRJNA591767,Integrated analyses of early responses to radiation in glioblastoma identify new alterations in RNA processing and candidate targets to improve treatment outcomes,"High-dose radiation is the main component of glioblastoma therapy. Unfortunately, radio-resistance is a common problem and a major contributor to tumor relapse. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving response to radiation is critical for identifying regulatory routes that could be targeted to improve treatment response. We conducted an integrated analysis in the U251 and U343 glioblastoma cell lines to map early alterations in the expression of genes at three levels: transcription, splicing, and translation in response to ionizing radiation. Overall design: Expression and Ribosome profilling of U251 and U343 glioblastoma cell lines at three time points T0, T1, and T24. U251 RNA-seq: T0 (2 replicates); T1 (3 replicates); T24 (3 replicates). U343 RNA-seq: T0 (3 replicates); T1( 3 replicates); T24 (3 replicates).

PRJNA591627,Multiple links between 5-methylcytosine content of mRNA and translation,"5-methylcytosine (m5C) is a prevalent base modification in tRNA and rRNA but it also occurs more broadly in the transcriptome, including in mRNA. In pursuit of potential links of m5C with mRNA translation, we performed polysome profiling of human HeLa cell lysates and subjected RNA from resultant fractions to efficient bisulfite conversion followed by RNA sequencing (bsRNA-seq). Bioinformatic filters for rigorous site calling were devised to reduce technical noise. We obtained ~1,000 candidate m5C sites in the wider transcriptome, most of which were found in exonic regions of mRNA. Multiple novel sites were validated by amplicon-specific bsRNA-seq in independent samples of either human HeLa, LNCap and PrEC cells. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated depletion of either the NSUN2 or TRDMT1 m5C:RNA methyltransferases showed a clear dependence on NSUN2 for the majority of tested sites in mRNA and noncoding RNA. Candidate m5C sites in mRNAs are enriched in 5'UTRs and near start codons, and commonly embedded in a local context reminiscent of the NSUN2-dependent m5C sites found in the variable loop of tRNA. Analysing mRNA sites across the polysome profile revealed that non-conversion levels, at bulk and for many individual sites, were inversely correlated with ribosome association. Altogether, these findings emphasise the major role of NSUN2 in making this mark transcriptome-wide and further substantiate a functional interdependence of cytosine methylation level with mRNA translation Overall design: Bisulfite RNA sequencing of HeLa cell polysome profiling-derived samples representing different translational states; in biological triplicates."
PRJNA591625,Sequence- and structure-specific cytosine-5 methylation in mRNAs by NSUN6,"Methylation is the most common internal modification in mRNA. While the highly abundant N6-methyladonsine (m6A) modification affects most aspects of mRNA function, the precise functions of the rarer 5-methylcytosine (m5C) remains largely unknown. Here, we map m5C in the human transcriptome using methylation-dependent individual-nucleotide resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) combined with RNA bisulfite sequencing. We identify NSUN6 as a methyltransferase with strong substrate specificity towards mRNA. NSUN6 primarily targeted three prime untranslated regions (3'UTR) at the consensus sequence motif CTCCA. Knockout and rescue experiments revealed that only mRNA methylation sites containing the consensus motif depended on the presence of NSUN6. Furthermore, ribosome profiling demonstrated that NSUN6-specific consensus motifs marked translation termination. However, even though NSUN6-methylated mRNAs were reduced in NSUN6 knockout cells, NSUN6 was dispensable for mouse embryonic development. Thus, our study identifies NSUN6 as methyltransferase targeting mRNA in a sequence- and structure-specific manner. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and total RNA-seq from human H9 and HEK293 cells. Control or NSUN6-knockout samples. Identification of NSUN6 methylation targets by miCLIP in human HEK293 cells."
PRJNA591214,Ribosome profiling of HEK-293T cells stably expressing wild-type and codon-optimized coagulation factor IX.,"RIBO-SEQ and mRNA-SEQ were conducted on HEK-293T cells stably expressing wild-type (WT, RefSeq NM_000133.3) and codon-optimized (CO) version of the F9 gene. The two version of the gene are drastically different in their codon usage (60.9%) but are translated into identical versions of coagulation factor IX in terms of its amino acid sequence. WT and CO (GeneArt) F9 ORFs were sub-cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) according to manufacturer's instructions to generate pcDNA3.1-F9-V5-His plasmids. Each fusion construct (WTF9-V5-His and COF9-V5-His) was sub-cloned into a lentiviral vector pTK642 (gift from Dr. Kafri, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) at the Pacl/Sfil site. Three independent experiments have each led to the generation of RIBO-SEQ and mRNA-SEQ data for both CO and WT control."

PRJNA590361,RNA metabolic rates profiling in Fragile X neurons,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by inactivation of FMR1 gene and loss of its encoded product the RNA binding protein FMRP, which generally represses translation of its target transcripts in the brain. In mouse models of FXS (i.e., Fmr1 knockout animals; Fmr1 KO), deletion of Cpeb1, which encodes a translational activator, mitigates nearly all pathophysiologies associated with the disorder. We have observed that the wide-spread dys-regulation of RNA abundance in Fmr1 KO brain cortex and its rescue to normal levels in Fmr1/Cpeb1 double KO mice were the driver of the observed dys-regulation and rescue of translation as measured by whole transcriptome ribosome occupany in the brain.  We hypothesize that in Fragile X brain there is wide spread dys-regulation at RNA stability level. Here we test this hypothesis by profiling RNA synthesis, processing and degradation rates in Fragile X and wild type neurons, by taking advantage of short 5-EU labeling and computational modeling. We show that, while RNA synthesis and processing rates were barely changed, there is wide-spread evelated RNA degradation rates in the Fragile X neurons, particularly for genes using optimal codons. Overall design: RNA metabolic labeling coupled to RNA-seq in Fmr1-KO and wild type mouse neurons"
PRJNA590355,Genome-wide survey of ribosome collision [anisomycin],"In protein synthesis, ribosome movement is not always smooth, rather often impeded by numerous reasons. Although the deceleration of ribosome defines the fates of the mRNAs and the synthesizing proteins, fundamental questions remain to be addressed including where ribosomes pause in mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid context causes the pausing, and how physiologically significant the slowdown of protein synthesis is. Here we surveyed the position of ribosome collisions, caused by ribosome pausing, at a genome-wide level using the modified ribosome profiling in human and zebrafish. The collided ribosomes, i.e. disome, emerge at various sites; the proline-proline-lysine motif, stop codons, and 3' UTR. The number of ribosomes in a collision is not limited to two, rather four to five, forming a queue of ribosomes. Especially, XBP1, a key modulator of unfolded protein response, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes thus acts as a substrate for ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to avoid the accumulation of undesired proteins in the absence of stress. Our results provide an insight into the causes and the consequences of ribosome slowdowns by dissecting the specific architecture of ribosomes. Overall design: Ribosome profiling"
PRJNA590189,Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq of Fragile X mouse brain cortex,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by inactivation of FMR1 gene and loss of its encoded product the RNA binding protein FMRP, which generally represses translation of its target transcripts in the brain. In mouse models of FXS (i.e., Fmr1 knockout animals; Fmr1 KO), deletion of Cpeb1, which encodes a translational activator, mitigates nearly all pathophysiologies associated with the disorder. Here we reveal unexpected wide-spread dys-regulation of RNA abundance in Fmr1 KO brain cortex and its rescue to normal levels in Fmr1/Cpeb1 double KO mice. Alteration and restoration of RNA levels are the dominant molecular events that drive the observed dys-regulation and rescue of translation as measured by whole transcriptome ribosome occupany in the brain. The RNAs down-regulated and rescued in these animal models are highly enriched for FMRP binding targets and have an optimal codon bias that would predict their stability in wild type and possible instability in FMRP knock-out brain. These results leads to a further study to profile RNA metabolism rates in Fragile X neurons. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq in brain cortex of WT and Fmr1-KO mice Please note that differential expression analyses between samples were generated by DEseq2 (RNADEseq_* and RPFDEseq_*) or Xtail (ROXtail_*) as indicated in the corresponding sample description field."
PRJNA589466,Robust partitioning of microRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes [Ribo-seq],"MicroRNA's function is defined by the targets it regulates. Despite miRNAs' crucial role in various cellular processes and disease states, the identification of their targets remains challenging. Existing methods suffer from high false-positive rates and are inadequate in differentiating direct targets from downstream regulatory changes. Here, we introduce a simple approach involving combined analysis of RNA-seq and Precise RunOn-seq (PRO-seq) (CARP) to effectively measure post-transcriptional regulation. We apply this approach to seven different miRNAs and robustly distinguish their direct targets from downstream changes. We validate the efficacy of our approach using argonaute-CLIP-seq. We show using CARP and ribosome-profiling analyses that accelerated mRNA decay is the major mode of target regulation by miRNAs. Additionally, our comparative analyses reveal that CARP aids in discovery of complex regulatory mechanisms and in capturing false-negatives of existing approaches. Furthermore, post-transcriptional changes measured using CARP uncover miRNA-dependent regulation of coding sites. Lastly, we demonstrate that PRO-seq provides mechanistic explanation of indirect targeting, unraveling miRNA regulatory networks. Finally, we believe that CARP is particularly suitable to study in vivo functions of miRNAs in primary cells. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of HEK293 cells with and without specific miRNAs by high-throughput sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina NextSeq500"
PRJNA589465,Robust partitioning of microRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes [PRO-seq],"The biological impact of microRNAs is determined by their targets, and robustly identifying direct miRNA targets remains challenging. Existing methods suffer from high false-positive rates and are unable to effectively differentiate direct miRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes. Here, we present a simple approach to deconvolute post-transcriptional and transcriptional changes using PRO-seq with RNA-seq. In combination, these methods allow us to systematically profile the regulatory impact of a miRNA. We refer to this approach as CARP: Combined Analysis of RNA-seq and PRO-seq. We apply CARP to multiple miRNAs and show that it robustly distinguishes direct targets from downstream changes, while greatly reducing false positives. We validate our approach using Argonaute eCLIP-seq and ribosome profiling, demonstrating that CARP defines a comprehensive repertoire of targets. We identify miRNA-specific activity of target sites within the coding region. CARP facilitates the dissection of complex changes in gene regulatory networks triggered by miRNAs and identification of transcription factors that underlie downstream regulatory changes. Given the robustness of the approach, CARP is particularly suitable for dissecting miRNA regulatory networks in vivo.

PRJNA589056,Analysis of lacking Nα-terminal acetylation of proteins by NatA and NatB in Saccharomyces cerevisiae on mRNA levels and protein synthesis,"N-terminal (Nt)-acetylation is a highly prevalent co-translational protein modification in eukaryotes, catalyzed by at least five Nt-acetyltransferases (Nat) with differing specificities. Nt-acetylation has been implicated in protein quality control but its broad biological significance remains elusive. We investigated the roles of the two major Nats of S. cerevisiae, NatA and NatB, by performing transcriptome and translatome profiling by using mRNA sequencing and ribosome profiling. The results are combined with global proteome, aggregome and stabilome datasets. To analyze previously proposed physiolocal roles of NatA and NatB in yeast cells on protein stability and interaction specific growth conditions such as different growth media and heat stress are used in addition to physiological growth. Overall design: mRNA sequencing and ribosome profiling of generated yeast strains lacking the N-terminal acetyltransferase complex catalytic subunit Naa10 (for NatA) or Naa20 (for NatB) in wild-type background or hml? background under different growth conditions (as indicated), each sample is prepared in replicates and wild-type yeast strain is used as reference (also in replicates)"
PRJNA588223,Master stress response gene ATF4 & other oncogenes are translated by DENR-dependent reinitiation,"Translation efficiency varies 1000-fold between different mRNAs, thereby strongly impacting protein expression. Translation of the master stress response gene ATF4 increases in response to stress, but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We discover here that translation initiation factors DENR, MCTS1 and eIF2D are absolutely required to induce ATF4 translation upon stress, by promoting translation reinitiation on the ATF4 5'UTR. Hence DENR and MCTS1 are important players in the cellular Integrated Stress Response. We find DENR and MCTS1 promote reinitiation after long uORFs with specific penultimate codons, due to the tRNA that remains attached to 40S ribosomes after translation termination. This provides a model for how DENR and MCTS1 promote translation reinitiation. Since cancer cells are exposed to many stresses, they require ATF4 for survival and proliferation. We find a strong correlation between DENR•MCTS1 expression and ATF4 activity across cancers. Additional oncogenes including a-Raf, c-Raf and Cdk4 have long uORFs and are translated in a DENR•MCTS1 dependent manner. This explains in part why DENR and MCTS1 are oncogenes. Overall design: We created a DENR KO Hela Cell line and carried out ribosome footprinting to determine translational targets of the DENR-MCTS1 complex."
PRJNA587780,From coarse to fine: The absolute Escherichia coli proteome under diverse growth conditions,"Accurate measurements of cellular protein concentrations are invaluable to quantitative studies of gene expression and physiology in living cells. Here, we developed a versatile mass spectrometric workflow based on data-independent acquisition proteomics (DIA/SWATH) together with a novel protein inference algorithm (xTop). We used this workflow to accurately quantify absolute protein abundances in E. coli for >2000 proteins over >60 growth conditions, including nutrient limitations, non-metabolic stresses and non-planktonic states. The resulting high-quality dataset of protein mass fractions allowed us to characterize proteome responses from a coarse (groups of related proteins) to a fine (individual) protein level. Hereby, a plethora of novel biological findings could be elucidated, including the generic upregulation of low-abundant proteins under various metabolic limitations, the non-specificity of catabolic enzymes upregulated under carbon limitation, the lack of large-scale proteome reallocation under stress compared to nutrient limitations, as well as surprising strain-dependent effects important for biofilm formation. These results present valuable resources for the systems biology community and can be used for future multi-omics studies of gene regulation and metabolic control in E. coli. Overall design: Three ribosome profiling datasets in E. coli (various strains: NCM3722, NQ1390, MG1655)."

Proteomics and ribosome profiling informed revisions of protein-coding genes, which included 44 start codon changes and 42 added proteins. We developed statistical methods for annotating transcript 5' and 3' ends enabling identification of 3940 TSSs and their corresponding promoters and 2091 transcription termination sites, which were distinguished from RNA processing sites by lack of an adjacent RNA 5' end.

PRJNA587444,Recruitment of mRNAs to P granules by gelation with intrinsically-disordered proteins (RNAseq and ribosome profiling),RNA granules are cellular condensates that contain RNAs and proteins. The mechanism that drive the recruitment of many mRNAs to RNA granules are not fully understood.  Here we characterize the assembly and transcriptome of the germ (P) granules of C. elegans. We find that mRNAs are recruited into P granules by condensation with the intrinsically-disordered protein MEG-3. MEG-3 binds ~500 mRNAs in C. elegans embryos in a sequence-independent manner that favors mRNAs with low ribosome coverage. Translational stress causes additional mRNAs to localize to P granules and translational activation correlates with P granule exit for two mRNAs coding for germ cell fate regulators. MEG-3/RNA condensates assembled in vitro are gel-like and trap mRNAs in a non-dynamic state. Our observations reveal similarities between P granules and stress granules and identify gelation with intrinsically-disordered proteins as a sequence-independent mechanism to enrich low-translation mRNAs in RNA granules Overall design: 12 embryonic samples are included in this submission. It contains 6 RNAseq (3 wild type and 3 meg-3meg-4 mutant) and 6 corresponding ribosome profiling (3 wild type and 3 meg-3meg-4 mutant).
PRJNA579549,Ribosome profiling study of Miwi-null testes,"piRNAs are a novel class of small noncoding RNAs that were recently identified in animal germ cells. This class of small noncoding RNAs is specifically associated with an evolutionarily conserved PIWI family proteins, which belong to the germline-specific members of the Argonaute protein family and are indispensable to germline development in animals. The PIWI/piRNA pathway has been deemed as an innate immune system that prevents mobile genetic elements from destabilizing DNA and that protects genome integrity in animal germ cells. By ribosome profiling using Miwi-null testes, we identified a group of ~600 mRNAs as likely direct piRNA targets for translational regulation in mouse spermatids. These results suggest that the mouse PIWI (MIWI)/piRNA is responsible for activating translation of a subset of spermiogenic mRNAs to coordinate with morphological transformation into elongated spermatids. Overall design: 8 biological samples are included in the study. These include RNA-seq and ribosome profiling in 24 dpp wild-type and Miwi-null testes."
PRJNA579539,Selective 40S footprinting reveals that scanning ribosomes remain cap-tethered in human cells,"Translation regulation occurs largely during initiation. Currently, translation initiation can be studied in vitro, but these systems lack features present in vivo and on endogenous mRNAs. Here we develop selective 40S footprinting for visualizing initiating 40S ribosomes on endogenous mRNAs in vivo. It pinpoints where on an mRNA initiation factors join the ribosome to act, and where they leave. We discover that in human cells most scanning ribosomes remain attached to the 5' cap. Consequently, only one ribosome scans a 5'UTR at a time, and 5'UTR length affects translation efficiency. We discover that eIF3B, eIF4G1 and eIF4E remain on translating 80S ribosomes with a decay half-length of ~12 codons. Hence ribosomes retain these initiation factors while translating short upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs), providing an explanation for how ribosomes can re-initiate translation after uORFs in humans. This method will be of use for studying translation initiation mechanisms in vivo. Overall design: Selective and total 40S and 80S footprinting was carried out on HeLa and NIH3T3 cells. Selective datasets were produced for factors eIF3B, eIF4E, eIF2S1 and eIF4G1."
PRJNA578863,High-Throughput Translational Profiling with riboPLATE-seq,"Protein synthesis is dysregulated in many diseases, but we lack a systems-level picture of how signaling molecules and RNA binding proteins interact with the translational machinery, largely due to technological limitations. Here we present riboPLATE-seq, a scalable method for generating paired libraries of ribosome-associated and total mRNA. As an extension of the PLATE-seq protocol, riboPLATE-seq utilizes barcoded primers for pooled library preparation, but additionally leverages rRNA immunoprecipitation on whole polysomes to measure ribosome association (RA). We demonstrate the performance of riboPLATE-seq and its utility in detecting translational alterations induced by inhibition of protein kinases. Overall design: 96 paired riboPLATE- and PLATE-seq libraries, corresponding to independent TS543 glioma neurosphere samples seeded on a 96-well plate, plus 13 RNA-seq and 10 ribosome profiling libraries. 6 replicates per drug treatment (PP242, MNK-i1, BKM120, PP242+BKM120, PP242+MNK-i1, BKM120+MNK-i1, AZD8055, 4EGi-1) and 48 DMSO-treated controls, plus three replicates each of ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing for PP242 or DMSO treatment at 30 minutes, two further replicates at 6 hours PP242 or DMSO treatment, and one additional unpaired 6-hour DMSO-treated RNA-seq library."
PRJNA578614,Molecular characterization of BRSK2 and BRSK1 kinases as negative regulators of the NRF2 transcription factor,"We found that the understudied Brain Specific Kinase 2 and 1 (BRSK2/1) proteins suppress NRF2-dependent transcription and NRF2 protein levels in a kinase-dependent fashion. Integrative phosphoproteomic screens, RNAseq profiling and follow-up validation studies revealed BRSK2/1-driven activation of AMPK and suppression of MTOR signaling. BRSK2 over-expression suppressed global protein synthesis and decreased ribosome-RNA associations, which results in decreased NRF2 protein levels. Overall, our data establish the BRSK1 and BRSK2 kinases as negative regulators of NRF2 via the AMPK/MTOR signaling axis. Overall design: Evaluation of BRSK2/1 induced changes in RNA via overexpression in HEK293Ts."
PRJNA578566,Selective Translation Complex Profiling in yeast and human Reveals Staged Initiation and Co-translational  Assembly of Initiation Factor Complexes [Yeast],"Translational control targeting mainly the initiation phase is central to the regulation of  gene expression. Understanding all of its aspects requires substantial technological  advancements. Here we modified yeast Translational Complex Profile sequencing  (TCP-seq), related to ribosome profiling, and adopted it for mammalian cells. Human  TCP-seq, capable of capturing footprints of 40S subunits (40Ses) in addition to 80S  ribosomes (80Ses), revealed that mammalian and yeast 40Ses distribute similarly  across 5'UTRs indicating considerable evolutionary conservation. We further  developed a variation called Selective TCP-seq (Sel-TCP-seq) enabling selection for  40Ses and 80Ses associated with an immuno-targeted factor in yeast and human. Sel-  TCP-seq demonstrated that eIF2 and eIF3 travel along 5'UTRs with scanning 40Ses to  successively dissociate upon start codon recognition.

PRJNA578373,Binding to the Ribosome by Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4B Drives Yeast Translational Control in Response to Urea,"The yeast eukaryotic initiation factor 4B binds the 40S subunit in translation preinitiation complexes (PICs) and promotes mRNA binding. Here we have compared the effects of disrupting eIF4B RNA- and ribosome-binding domains under ~1400 growth conditions. The RNA-binding RRM was dispensable for stress responses, but ribosome binding stimulated by the NTD promoted growth in response to a number of stressors through changes in translation. In particular, the NTD confers a strong growth advantage in the presence of the denaturing reagent, urea, and a number of osmolytes that require robust cellular integrity for survival. Ribosome profiling of cells with and without the NTD of eIF4B reveals changes in translation of mRNAs containing longer than average and highly structured 5-prime untranslated regions both normally, and in response to urea exposure. Because these changes require 40S binding, our results suggest eIF4B regulates mRNA recruitment as a part of the scanning PIC, rather than by activating isolated mRNPs prior to ribosome binding. This analysis indicates the cellular response to urea in yeast includes a translational component, driven by increased translation of mRNAs encoding proteins associated with the cellular periphery, and highlights the importance of the general translation factor eIF4B in adapting to external conditions. Overall design: Two biological replicates of each Saccharomyces culture of WT without urea, mutant without urea, WT with urea, and mutant with urea were harvested. Riboseq and RNAseq libraries were derived from each set of cells for a total of 16 libraries for illumina sequencing."
PRJNA578122,Disome and trisome profiling reveal targets of ribosome quality control,"The ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) system that resolves stalled translation events is activated when ribosomes collide and form disome, trisome or higher order complexes. However, it is unclear whether this system distinguishes collision complexes formed on defective mRNAs from those with functional roles on endogenous transcripts. Here, we performed disome and trisome footprint profiling in yeast and found collisions were enriched on diverse sequence motifs known to slow translation. When 60S recycling was inhibited, disomes accumulated at stop codons and could move into the 3'UTR to reinitiate translation. The ubiquitin ligase and RQC factor Hel2/ZNF598 generally recognized collisions but did not trigger degradation of endogenous transcripts. However, loss of Hel2 triggered the integrated stress response, via phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, thus linking these pathways. Our results suggest that Hel2 has a role in sensing ribosome collisions on endogenous mRNAs and such events may be important for cellular homeostasis. Overall design: 31 samples are included in the study (4 mRNA-Seq, 4 monosome footprints, 21 disome footprints, and 2 trisome footprints). Read sizes were examined according to lengths relevant for each type of analysis and aligned by 5' or 3' ends, as noted. Samples also differ according to media conditions (3-AT, anisomycin, etc.) and genotype. Some samples serve as biological replicates, as noted."
PRJNA577942,"Ribosome profiling in archaea reveals leaderless translation, novel translational initiation sites, and ribosome pausing at single codon resolution","Members of the third domain of life, the Archaea, are ubiquitous in all environments on Earth but remain understudied in many aspects including regulatory processes of the central dogma. Archaea present unique biology because they utilize a mosaic of molecular features from both Bacteria and Eukarya, along with unique features. The advent of a high-throughput view of the translation landscape via ribosome profiling in the Bacteria and the Eukarya has illuminated the complexity and previously underappreciated regulation of translation (i.e. translation efficiency, ribosome surveillance, etc.) that potentially has large scale effects on cellular functionality. Here, we developed ribosome profiling in a model archaeon, Haloferax volcanii and elucidated the translational landscape for the first time in the third domain of life. We coupled ribosome profiling with translation inhibitors to: (a) determine the size of the archaeal ribosome footprint, (b) systematically assign translation states of the ribosome to footprint lengths in a mostly leaderless transcriptome, (c) experimentally induce ribosome pauses and clarify the pausing landscape comprehensively, (d) identify putative novel proteins, including small open reading frames (smORFs), and (e) provide evidence that many genes initiate on putative alternative translation start sites (paTSS) around and within open reading frames (ORFs), demonstrating how a microorganism with a gene dense genome can produce proteins with distinct functions using the same gene. Overall design: H. volcanii H98 single colonies were picked and grown overnight at 42°C with shaking at 220 rpm in Hv-YPC medium supplemented with thymidine (50 µg/mL final concentration) until saturation (OD600 > 1.0). These cultures were diluted to OD600 0.02 in fresh media, grown to  OD600 0.4 and split evenly into two flasks; one flask was used as a no treatment control and the other was treated with either 1 mg/mL homo-harringtonine (CAS Number 26833-87-4), 20 mM serine hydroxamate (CAS Number 55779-32-3), or 100 µg/mL anisomycin, final concentrations. Cells were harvested by centrifugation or direct freezing of the culture in liquid nitrogen. For cells harvested by centrifugation, cultures were immediately centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 3 minutes at room temperature, the supernatant removed, and the pellets flashed frozen in liquid nitrogen. For cell lysis, the frozen pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of 1x lysis buffer (3.4 M KCl, 500 mM MgCl2, 50 mM CaCl2, 1 M Tris pH 7.5) with an additional 100 µg/mL anisomycin, transferred to a cryomill, and pulverized with 5 cycles (1 minute of grinding at 5 Hz, 1 minute of cooling). Lysates were then thawed at room temperature, centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes, and transferred to a new tube on ice. For direct freezing of cultures in liquid nitrogen, 100 mL of culture sprayed directly into liquid nitrogen using a serological pipette. The frozen culture form small pellets which are collected and 50g of pellets were weighed in order to add 1x lysis buffer (3.4 M KCl, 500 mM MgCl2, 50 mM CaCl2, 1 M Tris pH 7.5) and 100 µg/mL anisomycin to prevent ribosome elongation when thawed later on. The pellets were pulverized in a cryomill at 10 cycles due to the larger volume of input (1 minute of grinding at 10 Hz, 1 minute of cooling). The lysates were thawed at room temperature and ribosomes were pelleted over a 60% sucrose cushion (sucrose dissolved in lysis buffer) in an ultracentrifuge with a Ti-70 rotor at 60,000 rpm for 2 hours at 4°C. Ribosome pellets were resuspended in 200 µL lysis buffer. Cell lysates (from cells harvested by centrifugation or direct freezing) were processed by first treating 20 AU of lysate RNA (Nanodrop) with 12,000 units of MNase (Nuclease S7, Roche) for 1 hour at 25°C. After nuclease digestion, samples were loaded onto 10-50% sucrose gradients and RNA was isolated from monosome fractions as described above. Library preparation was performed as previously described (Muhammed, et al 2019). Briefly, 10 µg of RNA fragments was used to purify 15-45 nt RNA fragments by gel electrophoresis (15% TBE Urea gel); RNA fragments were treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB), then ligated to the linker (NEB Universal miRNA Cloning Linker) using T4 RNA ligase (NEB), and gel extracted from a 10% TBE Urea gel. Lastly, rRNA fragments were subtracted using the Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit for bacteria (Illumina), then fragments reverse transcribed with SuperScript III (Invitrogen) using custom primers previously described (Muhammed, et al 2019), template RNA was degraded using NaOH and high heat, gel extracted from a 10% TBE Urea gel, circularized using CircLigase (Epicentre) and PCR amplified (8-12 cycles) with Phusion polymerase (NEB) using custom primers (Muhammed, et al 2019), and PCR products gel extracted from a 10% TBE gels.

PRJNA576653,Stop Codon Context Influences Genome-Wide Stimulation of Termination Codon Readthrough by Aminoglycosides [Dataset 5],"Stop codon readthrough (SCR) occurs when the ribosome miscodes at a stop codon. Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3'UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418 treatment globally alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).

PRJNA576487,eIF1 discriminates against suboptimal initiation sites to prevent excessive uORF translation genome-wide,"The translation pre-initiation complex (PIC) scans the mRNA for an AUG codon in favorable context. Previous findings suggest that the factor eIF1 discriminates against non-AUG start codons by impeding full accommodation of Met-tRNAi in the P site of the 40S ribosomal subunit, necessitating eIF1 dissociation for start codon selection. Consistent with this, yeast eIF1 substitutions that weaken its binding to the PIC increase initiation at UUG codons on a mutant his4 mRNA and particular synthetic mRNA reporters; and also at the AUG start codon of the mRNA for eIF1 itself owing to its poor Kozak context. It was not known however whether such eIF1 mutants increase initiation at suboptimal start codons genome-wide. By ribosome profiling, we show that the eIF1-L96P variant confers increased translation of numerous upstream open reading frames (uORFs) initiating with either near-cognate codons (NCCs) or AUGs in poor context. The increased uORF translation is frequently associated with reduced translation of the downstream main coding sequences (CDS). Initiation is also elevated at the NCCs initiating N-terminal extensions on GRS1 and ALA1 mRNAs, and at a small set of main CDS AUG codons with especially poor context, including that of eIF1 itself.  Thus, eIF1 acts throughout the yeast translatome to discriminate against NCC start codons and AUGs in poor context; and impairing this function enhances the repressive effects of uORFs on CDS translation and alters the ratios of protein isoforms translated from near-cognate versus AUG start codons. Overall design: We examined the effect of sui1-L96P on global translational efficiencies (TEs) by ribosome footprint profiling of isogenic WT and sui1-L96Pstrains. The study includes 8 samples, comprised of 4 mRNA-Seq samples and 4 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from 2 biological replicates of sui1? mutant strains harboring plasmid-borne sui1-L96P or the WT SUI1 allele.

PRJNA566449,Induction of an alternative 5' leader enhances translation of Inpp5e and resistance to oncolytic virus infection,"Residual cell-intrinsic innate immunity in cancer cells hampers infection with oncolytic viruses. Control of mRNA translation is an important feature of innate immunity, yet the identity of mRNA substrates that participate in host defences remain ill-defined. We characterized the translatome of resistant murine “4T1” breast cancer cells infected with three of the most clinically advanced oncolytic viruses: Herpes Simplex virus 1, Reovirus and Vaccinia virus. Common among all three infections were translationally de-repressed mRNAs including Inpp5e, encoding an inositol 5-phosphatase that modifies lipid second messenger signalling. We found that viral infection induced expression of an Inpp5e mRNA variant that lacks repressive upstream open reading frames (uORFs) within its 5' leader and is efficiently translated. Furthermore, we show that INPP5E contributes to antiviral immunity by altering virus attachment. These findings uncover a role for translational control through alternative 5' leader expression and assign an antiviral function to the ciliopathy gene INPP5E. Overall design: Ribosome Profiling (RPF-Seq and RNA -Seq) of murine 4T1 breast cancer cells infected with different oncolytic viruses"

PRJNA566006,Translation switch from initiation to elongation needs Not4 and Not5 collaboration,"Not4 and Not5 are crucial components of the Ccr4-Not complex with pivotal functions in mRNA metabolism. Both associate with ribosomes but mechanistic insights on their function remain elusive. Here we determine that Not5 and Not4 synchronously impact translation initiation and Not5 alone alters translation elongation. Deletion of Not5 causes elongation defects in a codon-dependent fashion, increasing and decreasing the ribosome dwelling occupancy at minor and major codons respectively. This enhanced difference in codon translation velocities alters translation globally and enables normally kinetically unfavorable processes such as nascent chain deubiquitination to take place. In turn this leads to abortive translation and favors protein aggregation. These findings highlight the global impact of Not4 and Not5 in controlling the programmed local speed of mRNA translation. Overall design: Assessment of translation through ribosome footprinting, SILAC and tRNA abundance and charging levels"

PRJNA564290,Temperature-dependent regulation of upstream open reading frame translation in s. cerevisiae,"Translation of an mRNA in eukaryotes starts at AUG in most cases. Near-cognate codons (NCCs) such as UUG, ACG and AUU are also used as start sites at low levels in S. cerevisiae. Initiation from NCCs or AUGs in the 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs can lead to translation of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that might regulate expression of the main ORF (mORF). Although there is some circumstantial evidence that the translation of uORFs can be affected by environmental conditions, little is known about how it is affected by changes in growth temperature. Using reporter assays, we found that changes in growth temperature can affect translation from NCC start sites in yeast cells, suggesting the possibility that gene expression could be regulated by temperature by altering use of different uORF start codons. Using ribosome profiling, we provide evidence that growth temperature regulates the efficiency of translation of nearly 200 uORFs in S. cerevisiae. Of these uORFs, most that start with an AUG codon have increased translational efficiency at 37 °C relative to 30 °C and decreased efficiency at 20 °C. For translationally regulated uORFs starting with NCCs, we did not observe a general trend for the direction of regulation as a function of temperature, suggesting mRNA-specific features can determine the mode of temperature-dependent regulation. Consistent with this conclusion, the position of the uORFs in the 5'-leader relative to the 5'-cap and the start codon of the main ORF correlates with the direction of temperature-dependent regulation of uORF translation. We have identified several novel cases in which changes in uORF translation are inversely correlated with changes in the translational efficiency of the downstream main ORF. Our data suggest that translation of these mRNAs is subject to temperature-dependent, uORF-mediated regulation. Overall, our data suggest that alterations in the translation of specific uORFs by temperature can regulate gene expression in S. cerevisiae. Overall design: We examined the effect of changes in culture temperature on usage of alternate start sites upstream of the annotated start codon AUG (translation of upstream open reading frame i.e. uORF). We calculated global translational efficiencies (TEs) by ribosome footprint profiling of BY4741 cells cultured at multiple temperatures. The study includes 12 samples, comprised of 6 mRNA-Seq samples and 6 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from 2 biological replicates of cells cultured at 20 °C, 30 °C. and 37 °C.

PRJNA564089,Humans and other commonly used model organisms are resistant to cycloheximide-mediated biases in ribosome profiling experiments,"Ribosome profiling measures genome-wide translation dynamics at sub-codon resolution. Cycloheximide (CHX), a widely used translation inhibitor to arrest ribosomes in these experiments, has been shown to induce biases in yeast, questioning its use. However, whether such biases are present in datasets of other organisms including humans is unknown. Here we compare different CHX-treatment conditions in human cells and yeast in parallel experiments using an optimized protocol. We find that human ribosomes are not susceptible to conformational restrictions by CHX, nor does it distort gene-level measurements of ribosome occupancy, measured decoding speed or the translational ramp. Furthermore, CHX-induced codon-specific biases on ribosome occupancy are not detectable in human cells or other model organisms. This shows that reported biases of CHX are species-specific and that CHX does not affect the outcome of ribosome profiling experiments in most settings. Our findings provide a solid framework to conduct and analyze ribosome profiling experiments. Overall design: Comprehensive analysis of the effect of CHX on ribosome profiling experiments in different yeasts and mammalian cells. Libraries were generated with a highly standardized and optimized protocol to maximize comparability and to deduce CHX-specific biases."
PRJNA563844,Genome-wide transcriptomic and translatomic profiling in halofuginone and vehicle treated mouse fibroblasts,"Purpose: In mammals, glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) catalyzes the attachment of two amino acids, glutamic acid (E) and proline (P), to their cognate tRNAs for protein synthesis. We aim to study the mechanism of EPRS in translational regulation of cardiac fibrosis and establish EPRS or its downstream target genes as potential anti-fibrosis therapeutic targets. The goals of this study are to use next generation sequencing (NGS)-derived fibroblast transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) and translatome profiling (polysome-seq) followed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) methods to identify the downstream effector genes that are preferentially regulated by EPRS at the transcriptional and translational levels. Results: Using a well established data analysis workflow from the Genomic Research Center from University of Rochester Medical Center,  we analyzed RNA-seq and polysome-seq data. We have identified novel Pro-rich (PRR) gene pathways that are preferentially regulated by EPRS via enhanced translation elongation at Pro-rich codons and antagonized by Halofuginone. Considering the translation active state in both light and heavy polysome fractions, we redefined the 4 groups by overlapping genes from heavy and light polysome associated transcripts compared to their total RNA expression change (p value <0.05 for differential expressed genes). 1371 genes were downregulated at translation (indicated by polysome-seq) and steady-state mRNA (indicated by RNA-seq) levels, and 775 genes were upregulated at both levels. There are a small number of genes whose gene regulation was changed in the opposite direction at the mRNA and translation levels. These observations indicate a coordinated regulatory effect between steady-state mRNA level and translation efficiency under the EPRS inhibitory condition. KEGG analysis of the genes that are reduced at RNA and translation levels revealed multiple pro-fibrotic pathways, including ECM-receptor interaction and proteoglycans. In contrast, the genes that are induced at RNA and translation levels are enriched in general translation factors, including ribosome and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, which suggests a compensatory amino acid starvation response upon EPRS inhibition. Altered expression of typical Pro-rich collagen and other genes was confirmed with qRT-PCR.  Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of fibroblast translatome in comparison with transcriptome under EPRS inhibitory condition (halofuginone treatment), with biological triplicates, generated by RNA-seq and polysome-seq technology. Our results show that the next generation sequencing offers a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation of mRNA content and its translation state within cells treated with translation inhibitory drug halofuginone (EPRS inhibitor). Based on our results, we conclude that Pro-rich motif bearing genes are preferential targets of EPRS, and mild inhibition of EPRS leads to inefficient translation of these PRR genes. Overall design: We treated NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts with halofuginone (EPRS-specific inhibitor; 100 nM) or vehicle (PBS) in biological triplicates. For polysome-Seq, all the fractions were pooled into 3 samples, polysome free (free mRNP, 40S, 60S subunit), light polysomes (monosome, disome, trisome, etc.), and heavy polysomes (>5 ribosomes). Total RNA was extracted from the same volume of 3 samples and subjected to next generation RNA deep sequencing for translatome profiling as polysome-seq. For transcriptome profiling, total RNA extracted from the same treated cells was subjected to RNA-Seq. All the extracted RNA samples were treated with DNase I to remove potential genomic DNA followed by purification using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol for RNA-Seq. Raw reads were generated from the Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer in the Genomic Research Center from University of Rochester Medical Center."

PRJNA561206,Translation elongation factor 2 depletion by siRNA in mouse liver leads to mTOR-independent translational upregulation of ribosomal protein genes,"Due to breakthroughs in RNAi and genome editing methods in the past decade, it is now easier than ever to study fine details of protein synthesis in animal models. However, most of our understanding of translation comes from unicellular organisms and cultured mammalian cells. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of perturbing protein synthesis in a mouse liver by targeting translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) with RNAi. We were able to achieve over 90% knockdown efficacy and maintain it for 2 weeks effectively slowing down the rate of translation elongation. As the total protein yield declined, both proteomics and ribosome profiling assays showed robust translational upregulation of ribosomal proteins relative to other proteins. Although all these genes bear the TOP regulatory motif, the branch of the mTOR pathway responsible for translation regulation was not activated. Paradoxically, coordinated translational upregulation of ribosomal proteins only occurred in the liver but not in murine cell culture. Thus, the upregulation of ribosomal transcripts likely occurred via passive mTOR-independent mechanisms. Impaired elongation sequesters ribosomes on mRNA and creates a shortage of free ribosomes. This leads to preferential translation of transcripts with high initiation rates such as ribosomal proteins. Furthermore, severe eEF2 shortage reduces the negative impact of positively charged amino acids frequent in ribosomal proteins on ribosome progression. Overall design: 8 cell culture transcriptomes (4 control and 4 eef2 knockdowns); transcriptomes from 12 mouse livers (control, 7, 9 and 12 days; three animals in each group); 6 ribo-seq libraries prepared from the same tissues (matched within animal)"
PRJNA560549,Translational initiation in E. coli occurs at the correct sites genome-wide in the absence of mRNA-rRNA base-pairing,"Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motifs are thought to play an important role in translational initiation in bacteria. Paradoxically, ribosome profiling studies in E. coli show no correlation between the strength of the SD in an mRNA and how efficiently it is translated. Performing profiling on ribosomes with altered anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequences, we reveal a genome-wide correlation between SD strength and ribosome occupancy that was previously masked by other contributing factors. Using the antibiotic retapamulin to trap initiation complexes at start codons, we find that the mutant ribosomes select start sites correctly, arguing that start sites are hard-wired for initiation through the action of other mRNA features. We show that A-rich sequences upstream of start codons promote initiation. Taken together, our genome-wide study reveals that SD motifs are not necessary for the ribosome to select where initiation occurs, though they do affect how efficiently initiation occurs at sites whose other features support initiation.

PRJNA559859,A p53-dependent translational program directs tissue-selective phenotypes in a model of ribosomopathies,"In ribosomopathies, perturbed expression of ribosome components leads to tissue-specific phenotypes. What accounts for such tissue-selective manifestations as a result of mutations in the ribosome, a ubiquitous cellular machine, has remained a mystery. Combining mouse genetics and in vivo ribosome profiling, we observe limb patterning phenotypes in ribosomal protein (RP) haploinsufficient embryos and uncover selective translational changes of transcripts controlling limb development. Surprisingly, both loss of p53, which is activated by RP haploinsufficiency, and augmented protein synthesis rescue these phenotypes. These findings are explained by the identification that p53 functions as a master regulator of protein synthesis, at least in part, through transcriptional activation of 4E-BP1. 4E-BP1, a key translational regulator, in turn, facilitates selective changes in the translatome downstream of p53, and thereby explains how RP haploinsufficiency may elicit specificity to gene expression. These results provide an integrative model to understand how in vivo tissue-specific phenotypes emerge in ribosomopathies.

This regulatory mechanisms has been shown to play crucial roles throughout the whole life cycle of animals and plants as well as in disease. While a plethora of methods exist to predict targets of miRNA, which suggest that up to 80% of the genome is miRNA regulated, it has recently been reported that many of these predictions are false positives, cell type specific or represent non-functional binding. In order to identify the subset of real functional miRNAs and their targets, we established miRNA pathway mutants in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), allowing the dissection of canonical and non-canonical functions of pathway members. Additional data integration of downstream regulatory layers (CLIP-seq, ribosome profiling and MS) enabled us to follow and track down real functional miRNA-gene interactions, which reduced the miRNA  genome regulation to approximately 1%. Overall design: Purpose: The goals of this study was to obtain the ribosome binding profile of WT and RNAi mutant mESCs.

PRJNA559103,Regulated local synthesis of ribosomal proteins maintains ribosome function in axons,"Ribosome assembly occurs mainly in the nucleolus yet recent studies have revealed robust enrichment and translation of mRNAs encoding many ribosomal proteins (RPs) in axons, far away from neuronal cell bodies. Here, we report a physical and functional interaction between locally synthesized RPs and ribosomes in the axon. We show that axonal RP translation is regulated through a novel sequence motif, CUIC, that forms an RNA-loop structure in the region immediately upstream of the initiation codon. Using imaging and subcellular proteomics techniques, we show that RPs synthesized in axons join axonal ribosomes in a nucleolus-independent fashion. Inhibition of axonal CUIC-regulated RP translation causes a significant decline in local translation activity and markedly reduces axon branching in the brain, revealing the physiological relevance of axonal RP synthesis in vivo. These results suggest that axonal translation supplies cytoplasmic RPs to maintain/modify local ribosomal function far from the nucleolus in neurons.

PRJNA558563,Comprehensive Annotations of Human Herpesvirus 6A and 6B Genomes Reveals Novel and Conserved Genomic Features,"Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) A and B are highly ubiquitous betaherpesviruses, infecting the majority of the human population. Like other herpesviruses, our understanding of their protein coding potential is far from complete. Here we use ribosome profiling and RNA-seq to experimentally define the HHV-6 translation products and to follow their temporal expression. We identified hundreds of new open reading frames (ORF)s, including many upstream ORFs (uORF)s and internal ORFs (iORF)s, generating a complete atlas of HHV-6 translation products.  Integrating data from human cytomegalovirus we uncover numerous uORFs and iORFs that are conserved between beta herpesviruses and we show uORFs are specifically enriched in late viral genes. We also identified three highly abundant viral long non coding RNAs (lncRNA)s and we show one of these lncRNAs generate a non-polyadenylated stable intron that is conserved between all sequenced beta herpesviruses. Overall, this work uncovers the full complexity of the HHV-6 family genomes and highlights novel features that are conserved between beta herpesviruses, providing a resource for future functional studies.

PRJNA558460,Receptor-specific interactome as a hub for rapid cue-induced selective translation in axons,"During neuronal wiring, extrinsic cues trigger the local translation of specific mRNAs in axons via cell surface receptors. The coupling of ribosomes to receptors has been proposed as a mechanism linking signals to local translation but it is not known how broadly this mechanism operates, nor whether it can selectively regulate mRNA translation. We report that receptor-ribosome coupling is employed by multiple guidance cue receptors and this interaction is mRNA-dependent. We find that different receptors bind to distinct sets of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Cue stimulation induces rapid dissociation of ribosomes from receptors and the selective translation of receptor-specific mRNAs in retinal axon growth cones. Further, we show that receptor-ribosome dissociation and cue-induced selective translation are inhibited by simultaneous exposure to translation-repressive cues, suggesting a novel mode of signal integration. Our findings reveal receptor-specific interactomes and provide a general model for the rapid, localized and selective control of cue-induced translation.

PRJNA556704,A global overview of translation efficiency and ribosome occupancy at nucleotide resolution in HEK293 cells,Looking at ribosome distribution and translational efficiency in control conditions in HEK293 cell line. Combining this information with our other datasets from HEK293 cells has allowed us to look at ribosome occupancy of specific groups of mRNAs Overall design: Ribosome Profiling conducted in HEK293 cells treated with control siRNA. Ribo-zero treated total RNA for the same samples is also included.
PRJNA556678,Transcriptome-wide analysis of RNA structure in MCF7 cells with and without inhibition of eIF4A by hippuristanol treatment,"Translational dysregulation is an emerging hallmark of cancer, and increased activity of the mRNA helicase eIF4A is associated with poor survival in malignancies. This is believed to be due to the unwinding of secondary structures within the 5'UTRs of oncogenic mRNAs, with studies showing that in general eIF4A-dependent mRNAs have longer 5'UTRs with more stable secondary structures, yet our ability to predict eIF4A-dependency from 5'UTR properties alone remains poor. We therefore used Structure-seq 2 to measure transcriptome-wide changes in RNA structure in MCF7 cells, following eIF4A inhibition with hippuristanol. This technique measures the single-strandedness of RNA by specific and rapid methylation of single-stranded adenosines and cytosines with Dimethyl Sulphate (DMS). When paired with polysome profiling data to identify which mRNAs are most translationally repressed, we can identify the structural determinants of eIF4A-dependency. Upon eIF4A inhibition, both 5'UTRs and CDSs become generally more structured, while overall this was not observed for 3'UTRs. This was most pronounced in CDSs, supporting recent findings that the ribosome sculpts RNA structure in this region. 5'UTRs are generally more structured at their 5' ends and highly translated mRNAs are less structured just upstream of the CDS. Following eIF4A inhibition, the 5'UTR is remodelled. eIF4A-dependent mRNAs have greater localised gains of structure. The degree of these structural changes is strongly correlated with 5'UTR length, explaining why eIF4A-dependent mRNAs have longer 5'UTRs. Crucially, in eIF4A-dependent mRNAs these highly-structured elements are located predominantly at the 3' end of the 5'UTR, suggesting that increased structure just upstream of the CDS is most inhibitory to translation following eIF4A inhibition and is a key determinant of eIF4A-dependency. Overall design: MCF7 cells were treated with and without dimethyl sulphate (DMS) following treatment with and without hippuristanol in triplicate. Poly(A) RNA was extracted and underwent Structure-seq 2 library preparation"

Overall design: Expression plasmids containing recoded IAV neuramindase were transfected into HEK 293T cells and translational dynamics of neuraminidase mRNA was determined by ribosome footprint-profiling experiments
PRJNA556006,The Dynamics of Cytoplasmic mRNA Metabolism,"For all but a few mRNAs, the dynamics of metabolism are unknown. Here, we developed an experimental and analytical framework for examining these dynamics for mRNAs from thousands of genes. mRNAs of mouse fibroblasts exit the nucleus with diverse intragenic and intergenic poly(A)-tail lengths. Once in the cytoplasm, they have a broad (1000-fold) range of deadenylation rates, which correspond to cytoplasmic lifetimes. Indeed, degradation appears to occur primarily through deadenylation-linked mechanisms, with little contribution from endonucleolytic cleavage or deadenylation-independent decapping. Most mRNA molecules degrade only after their tail lengths fall below 25 nt. Decay rates of short-tailed mRNAs vary broadly (1000-fold) and are more rapid for short-tailed mRNAs that had previously undergone more rapid deadenylation. This coupling helps clear rapidly deadenylated mRNAs, enabling the large range in deadenylation rates to impart a similarly large range in stabilities. Overall design: The experiments consist of ribosome profiling libraries (small RNA-seq and RPF reads) from two microRNA-inducible 3T3 cell lines (miR-1 and miR-155) with or without microRNA induction. These samples were prepared for 5 and 6 metabolic-labeling time points for the miR-1 and miR-155 lines, respectively. In addition, a metabolic labeling/transcriptional shutoff experiment was performed which generated 12 sequences samples made with the NEXTflex RNA-seq kit. Finally, 38 PAL-seq samples from these time courses are also included to measure poly(A)-tail lengths."
PRJNA555528,Transcriptome-wide sites of collided ribosomes reveal sequence determinants of translational pausing in vivo,"Translation initiation is considered overall rate-limiting for protein biosynthesis, whereas the impact of non-uniform ribosomal elongation rates is largely unknown. Using a modified ribosome profiling protocol based on footprints from two closely packed ribosomes (disomes), we have mapped ribosomal collisions transcriptome-wide in mouse liver. We uncover that the stacking of an elongating onto a paused ribosome occurs frequently and scales with translation rate, trapping ~10% of translating ribosomes in the disome state. A distinct class of pause sites, independent of translation rate, is indicative of deterministic pausing signals. We find pause sites associated with specific codons, amino acids, and peptide motifs, and with structural features of the nascent polypeptide, suggestive of programmed pausing as a widespread mechanism associated with protein folding. Evolutionary conservation at disome sites and experiments indicate functional relevance of translational pausing. Collectively, our disome profiling approach allows novel and unexpected insights into gene regulation occurring at the step of translation elongation. Overall design: Six biological samples (3 timepoints x 2 replicates) from GSE67305 were used. Briefly, mice were entrained under 12hours light:dark conditions for 2 weeks and also collected under 12hours light:dark. Mice were sacrificed at 0, 2, and 12h during the 24 hours daily cycle. Two replicates per time point, each replicate is a pool of 2 livers (2 mice)."
PRJNA554781,High throughput ribosome profiling of E. coli expressing a library of heterologous proteins,Heterologous gene expression to expand the native genetic capability of E. coli is the backbone of protein expression and metabolic engineering. The goal of this study was to determine how the identity of the heterologous gene expressed affected the host cell transcriptome. We generated a library of E. coli expressing 46 heterologous genes through an identical rhamnose inducible expression system and perform high throughput ribosome profiling. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of 46 heterologous gene expressing lines of E. coli using the same expression system
PRJNA554579,Experimental evolution reveals the genetic basis and systems biology of superoxide stress tolerance,"E. coli frequently encounters oxidative stress both in its natural environment or in industrial biotechnology. Elucidating the mechanisms behind tolerance to oxidative stress would be beneficial for understanding pathogenesis as well as improving production strain fitness. We make use of adaptive laboratory evolution to develop two strains of E. coli which exhibit 500% increased tolerance to paraquat stress compared to wild type. Evolved strains tolerate oxidative stress by reduction of flux through TCA, dyregulation of iron-uptake genes, and up-regulation of cell motility or iron-sulfur cluster repair genes. Overall design: Tolerization adaptive laboratory evolution to increase tolerance to paraquat. Transcriptomics was performed on 2 end point strains and WT with and without addition of paraquat. Ribosome profiling was performed on WT, 1 end point strain and a mid-point strain to investigate read-through of a non-sense mutation in aceE PQ1 and PQ2 are end-point strains from an adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) which took place over 33 days and a total of 8x10^11 cumulative cell divisions (CCD). GLU4 is the wild type strain which comes from LaCroix et. al. 2015 (doi: 10.1128/AEM.02246-14 ). The MP strain was isolated from the midpoint of the evolution of PQ2 at 6x10^11 CCD. Genome mutations for these strains will be available at ALEdb (Phaneuf et. al. 2019 - https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky983)"
PRJEB30076,Ribosome profiling of chondrocytic cell line SW1353 following exposure to IL-1B,"Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterised by the loss of articular cartilage in synovial joints through a process of extracellular matrix destruction that is strongly associated with inflammatory stimuli. Chondrocytes undergo changes to their protein translation capacity during osteoarthritis, but a study of how disease-relevant signals effect chondrocyte protein translation at the transcriptomic level has not previously been performed. In this study we describe how the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1-beta (IL-1ß) rapidly affects protein translation in the chondrocytic cell line SW1353. Using ribosome profiling we demonstrate that IL-1ß induced altered translation of inflammatory-associated transcripts such as NFKB1, TNFAIP2, MMP13, CCL2 and CCL7, as well as a number of ribosome-associated transcripts, through differential translation and the use of multiple open reading frames. Proteomic analysis of the cellular layer and the conditioned media of these cells identified that proteins which were differentially translated were most readily detected in the secretome. These translationally regulated secreted proteins included a number of chemokines and cytokines, underlining the rapid, translationally-mediated inflammatory cascade that is initiated by IL-1 ß."
PRJNA554100,RNAseq and ribosome profiling of yeast cells grown under glucose restriction condition.,"We investigate the mechanism by which glucose restriction extends yeast replicative lifespan, using an approach that combines ribosomal profiling and RNA-seq. We systematically compared the translational and transcriptional profiles of cells grown in glucose restriction and normal media, uncovering groups of functionally related genes that are up or down regulated. Overall design: We used two different protocols to grow cell culture in SD vs. GR conditions.  1) protocol-1: Quick Dilution from SD (2% glucose) to GR (0.05% glucose): the initial cell culture was incubated in SD medium overnight to OD600 0.8~1.0, then diluted by 5 fold using SD media and incubated for another 4 hours. The sample was then divided equally into two aliquots. One was diluted  40 times by pre-warmed SD medium with 0% glucose to reach final 0.05% glucose concentration (the sample), and the other diluted 40 times by pre-warmed SD medium with 2% glucose (the control). Both samples were incubated for another hour before harvesting. All the steps were carried out at 30°C.  2) protocol-2: Spin-down and re-suspension from SD to GR : the initial cell culture was incubated in SD medium overnight to a OD600 0.8~1.0, then diluted by 5 fold using SD medium and incubated for another 4 hours.  The sample was then divided equally into 2 aliquots. Cells were separated from the media by spin-down at 2000 rcf for 5 minutes and re-suspended into SD and GR media respectively. All samples were incubated for for another hour before harvesting. All the steps were carried out at 30°C.  Ribosomal profiling experiments were carried out using the protocol developed by Ingolia et al.  Raw sequences were obtained from Illumina Hiseq 2000."
PRJNA553522,LIN28A binds to meiotic gene transcripts and modulates their translation in male germ cells,"The RNA-binding protein LIN28A is required for maintaining tissue homeostasis, including in the reproductive system, but the underlying mechanisms on how LIN28A regulates germline progenitors remain unclear. Here, we dissected LIN28A-binding targets using high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) in the mouse testes. LIN28A preferentially binds to mRNA coding sequence (CDS) or 3'UTR regions at sites enriched wiGAG(A) sequences. Further investigation of Lin28a null mouse testes indicated that meiosis-associated mRNAs bound by LIN28A were differentially expressed. Next, ribosome profiling revealed that the mRNA levels of these targets were significantly reduced in polysome fractions, and their protein expression levels decreased in the Lin28a null mouse testes, even when meiotic arrest in the null mouse testes was not apparent. Collectively, these findings provide a set of LIN28A-regulated target mRNAs, and show that LIN28A binding might be mechanism through which LIN28A acts to regulate undifferentiated spermatogonia fates and male fertility in mammals. Overall design: Triplicate identification of transcripts associated with LIN28A in mice testes, triplicate mRNA profiles profile of Lin28a knockout and control in 10dpp mouse testes were generated by deep sequencing."
PRJNA553494,Mammalian RNA decay pathways are highly specialized and widely linked to translation,"RNA decay is crucial for RNA turnover and surveillance, and misregulated in many diseases. This complex system is challenging to study, particularly in mammals, where it remains unclear whether decay pathways perform specialized or redundant roles. Cytoplasmic pathways, and links to translation, are particularly enigmatic. By directly profiling targets of decay factors (XRN1, SKIV2L and MTR4) and normal/aberrant translation events in mouse embryonic stem cells, we uncovered extensive specialization between decay pathways and crosstalk with translation. XRN1 (5'-3') mediated cytoplasmic bulk mRNA turnover whereas SKIV2L (3'-5') was universally recruited by ribosomes, tackling aberrant translation and sometimes modulating mRNA abundance. Further exploring translation surveillance, we identified AVEN and FOCAD as SKIV2L interactors. AVEN prevented ribosome stalls at structured regions, which otherwise required SKIV2L for clearance. This pathway was crucial for histone translation, uORF regulation and counteracting spurious non-coding RNA translation. In summary, we identified key targets, components and functions of mammalian RNA decay pathways, and uncovered extensive coupling to translation. Overall design: mESCs with endogenously 3xFLAG-Avi-tagged decay factors (either MTR4, SKIV2L, XRN1 or AVEN) were used for crosslinking and analysis of cDNAs (CRAC), to identify transcriptome-wide direct RNA binding sites. Various WT or knockout cell lines were also profiled by RNA-seq, and some CRAC experiments were repeated in knockout backgrounds."

PRJNA553142,CircMYBL2 Regulates FLT3-ITD FLT3AML Translation in AML,"CircMYBL2 is more highly expressed in AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutations than in those without the FLT3-ITD mutation. We found that circMYBL2 knockdown specifically inhibits proliferation and promotes the differentiation of FLT3-ITD AML cells in vitro and in vivo. We used the ribosome profiling and RNA-seq libraries sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2500 to identify the mRNA that circMYBL2 targeted. Interestingly, we found that circMYBL2 significantly influences the protein level of mutant FLT3 kinase, which contributes to the activation of FLT3-ITD-dependent signaling pathways. Mechanistically, circMYBL2 enhanced the translational efficiency of FLT3 kinase by increasing the binding of PTBP1 to FLT3 mRNA. Moreover, circMYBL2 knockdown impaired the cytoactivity of inhibitor-resistant FLT3-ITD-positive cells, with a significant decrease in FLT3 kinase expression, followed by the inactivation of its downstream pathways. In summary, we are the first to reveal a circRNA that specifically influences FLT3-ITD AML and regulates FLT3 kinase levels through translational regulation, suggesting that circMYBL2 may be a potential therapeutic target for FLT3-ITD AML. Overall design: Sh-NC and sh-circMYBL2 MOLM-13 cells used"
PRJNA552553,RNA: The translational landscape of ground state pluripotency,"Translational control plays a central role in regulation of gene expression and can lead to significant divergence between mRNA- and protein-abundance. Here we used genome-wide approaches combined with time-course analysis to measure the mRNA-abundance, mRNA-translation rate and protein expression during the transition of naïve-to-primed mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We find that the ground state ESCs cultured with GSK3-, MEK-inhibitors and LIF (2iL) display higher ribosome density on a selective set of mRNAs. This set of mRNAs undergo  strong translational buffering to maintain stable protein expression levels in 2iL-ESCs. Importantly, we show that the global alteration of cellular proteome during the transition of naïve to primed pluripotency is largely accompanied by transcriptional rewiring. Thus, we provide a comprehensive and detailed overview of the global changes in gene expression in different states of ESCs and dissect the relative contributions of RNA-transcription, translation and regulation of protein stability in controlling protein abundance. Overall design: Analysis of genome wide mRNA translation by ribosome profiling and mRNA expression by RNA-seq. 9-conditions were used that include: 2iL, 2iLday1, 2iLday3, 2iLday7, SL, SLday1, SLday3, SLday7, EpiLSCs. Biological duplicates were used per condition; they are indicated as Rep1 and Rep2. In total 18 samples for RNA-seq and 18-samples for Ribosome profiling were generated."

PRJNA551384,Genome-wide survey of ribosome collision [monosome/disome],"In protein synthesis, ribosome movement is not always smooth, rather often impeded by numerous reasons. Although the deceleration of ribosome defines the fates of the mRNAs and the synthesizing proteins, fundamental questions remain to be addressed including where ribosomes pause in mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid context causes the pausing, and how physiologically significant the slowdown of protein synthesis is. Here we surveyed the position of ribosome collisions, caused by ribosome pausing, at a genome-wide level using the modified ribosome profiling in human and zebrafish. The collided ribosomes, i.e. disome, emerge at various sites; the proline-proline-lysine motif, stop codons, and 3' UTR. The number of ribosomes in a collision is not limited to two, rather four to five, forming a queue of ribosomes. Especially, XBP1, a key modulator of unfolded protein response, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes thus acts as a substrate for ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to avoid the accumulation of undesired proteins in the absence of stress. Our results provide an insight into the causes and the consequences of ribosome slowdowns by dissecting the specific architecture of ribosomes. Overall design: Ribosome profiling"
PRJNA551383,Defining codon-mediated mRNA decay and No-go decay in zebrafish embryos,"The control of mRNA stability plays a central role in regulating gene expression patterns. While much is known about the roles of 5´ and 3´ untranslated regions in the mRNA stability control, the impact of protein-coding sequences on mRNA stability had been obscure. Recently, several groups reported that codon composition in the ORF affects mRNA deadenylation and degradation rates in a translation-dependent manner. Hence, codons define not only the amino acid sequences to be synthesized but also the stability of mRNAs. However, how 61 codons differently affect mRNA stability remains unclear. Besides, aberrant stalling of the ribosome induces ribosome quality control (RQC) and No-go decay. The relationship between the two co-translational mRNA decay pathways is not systematically analyzed.     To precisely characterize the effects of 61 codons on mRNA stability, we developed a simplified reporter system that allows detection of the effect of every single codon on mRNA stability in zebrafish embryos. Using this system, we show that the effect of codons on mRNA stability is partially but significantly correlated with the translation elongation rate and tRNA abundance. Interestingly, the codon effect is still maintained in zebrafish embryos lacking Znf598, an essential mediator of RQC and NGD. Znf598-dependent NGD targets a particular type of ribosome stalling but has limited impact on endogenous mRNA stability. Our study thus defines two related co-translational mRNA decay pathways during animal development. Overall design: Ribosome profiling"
PRJNA551280,Pairs of amino acids at the P- and A-sites of the ribosome predictably and causally modulate translation-elongation rates,"Variation in translation-elongation kinetics along a transcript's coding sequence plays an important role in the maintenance of cellular protein homeostasis by regulating co-translational protein folding, localization, and maturation. Translation-elongation speed is influenced by molecular factors within mRNA and protein sequences. For example, when proline is present in the ribosome's P- or A-site translation slows down, but the effect of other pairs of amino acids, in the context of all 400 possible pairs, has not been characterized. Here, we study Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a combination of mutational experiments, bioinformatics, and evolutionary analyses, and show that many different pairs of amino acids and their associated tRNA molecules predictably and causally encode translation rate information when these pairs are present in the A- and P-sites of the ribosome independent of other factors known to influence translation speed, including mRNA structure, wobble base pairing, tripeptide motifs, positively charged upstream nascent chain residues, and cognate tRNA concentration. The fast-translating pairs of amino acids that we identify are enriched seven-fold relative to the slow-translating pairs across Saccharomyces cerevisiae's proteome, while the slow-translating pairs are enriched downstream of domain boundaries. Thus, the chemical identity of amino acid pairs contributes to variability in translation rates, elongation kinetics are causally encoded in the primary structure of proteins, and signatures of evolutionary selection indicate their potential role in co-translational processes. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of mutant strains with mutations spread across 5 genes in S288C yeast cells"
PRJNA551033,C6orf203 is an RNA-binding protein involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis,"In all biological systems, RNAs are associated with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), forming complexes that control gene regulatory mechanisms, from RNA synthesis to decay. In mammalian mitochondria, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is conducted by mitochondrial RBPs (mt-RBPs) at various stages of mt-RNA metabolism, including polycistronic transcript production, its processing into individual transcripts, mt-RNA modifications, stability, translation, and degradation. To date, only a handful of mt-RBPs have been characterized. Here, we describe a putative human mitochondrial protein, C6orf203, that contains an S4-like domain - an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding domain previously identified in proteins involved in translation. Our data show C6orf203 to bind highly-structured RNA in vitro and associate with the mitoribosomal large subunit in HEK293T cells. Knockout of C6orf203 leads to a decrease in mitochondrial translation and consequent OXPHOS deficiency, without affecting mitochondrial RNA levels. Although mitoribosome stability is not affected in C6orf203-depleted cells, mitoribosome profiling analysis revealed a global disruption of the association of mt-mRNAs with the mitoribosome, suggesting that C6orf203 may be required for the proper maturation and functioning of the mitoribosome. We therefore propose C6orf203 to be a novel RNA-binding protein involved in mitochondrial translation, expanding the repertoire of factors engaged in this process. Overall design: Mitochondrial Ribosome profiling RNASeq data of Mitochondrial ribosomal profling from C6orf203 knock-out HEK cells versus wildtype"
PRJNA550323,Monosomes actively translate synaptic mRNAs in neuronal processes,"In order to deal with their huge volume and complex morphology, neurons localize mRNAs and ribosomes near synapses to produce proteins locally. A relative paucity of polyribosomes (considered the active sites of translation) detected in electron micrographs of neuronal processes (axons and dendrites), however, has suggested a rather limited capacity for local protein synthesis. Polysome profiling together with ribosome footprinting of microdissected synaptic regions revealed that a surprisingly high number of dendritic and/or axonal transcripts were predominantly associated with monosomes (single ribosomes). Contrary to prevailing views, the neuronal monosomes were in the process of active protein synthesis (e.g. they exhibited elongation). Most mRNAs showed a similar translational status in both compartments, but some transcripts exhibited differential ribosome occupancy in the somata and neuropil. Strikingly, monosome-preferred transcripts often encoded high-abundance synaptic proteins. This work suggests a significant contribution of monosome translation to the maintenance of the local neuronal proteome. This mode of translation can presumably solve some of restricted space issues (given the large size of polysomes) and also increase the diversity of proteins made from a limited number of ribosomes available in dendrites and axons."
PRJEB32965,"Pervasive, non-functional translation in mycobacterium tuberculosis","Open reading frame (ORF) boundaries in bacterial genomes have largely been drawn by gene prediction algorithms. However, these algorithms often fail to predict ORFs with non-canonical features, including those that are short, overlapping, or lack 5' UTRs. Recent developments in genome-scale mapping of translation have facilitated the empirical identification of open reading frames (ORFs). Here, we use ribosome profiling approaches to map initiating and elongating ribosomes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus, we identify over 1,000 novel ORFs, revealing that much of the M. tuberculosis genome encodes proteins in overlapping reading frames, and/or on both strands. Most of the novel ORFs are short (sORFs), impeding their identification by traditional methods. The strong codon bias that characterizes annotated mycobacterial ORFs is not evident in the aggregate novel sORFs, and hence most are unlikely to encode functional proteins. Thus, our data suggest that bacterial transcriptomes are subject to pervasive translation that occurs as a result of the relatively low specificity requirements of initiating ribosomes. We speculate that the inefficiency of expressing spurious sORFs may be offset by positive contributions to M. tuberculosis biology through cis and trans regulatory activities of a small subset."

PRJNA549955,Ribosome profiling of A549 cells depleted of RPLP1 and RPLP2 and infected with DENV.,"We used ribosome profiling to evaluate viral and cellular translation in RPLP1/2-depleted cells. This revealed that ribosomes pause in the sequence coding for the N-terminus of the envelope protein, immediately downstream of sequences encoding two adjacent transmembrane domains (TMDs). RPLP1/2 function to enhance ribosome elongation at this position and increase viral protein stability, possibly by improving co-translational folding of DENV proteins. We also analyzed the effects of RPLP1/2 depletion on cellular translation. We find that RPLP1/2 moderately affects ribosome density for a small subset of cellular mRNAs. However, meta-analysis of ribosome positions on all cellular mRNAs revealed slightly increased accumulation of ribosomes downstream of start codons in RPLP1/2-depleted cells, suggesting that RPLP1/2 enhance elongation efficiency. Importantly, we found that ribosome density on mRNAs encoding multiple TMDs was disproportionately affected by RPLP1/2 knockdown, suggesting a role for RPLP1/2 in transmembrane protein biogenesis. Together, our findings reveal insights into the function of RPLP1/2 in DENV and cellular translation. Overall design: A549 cells were plated at 1.5 x 106 cells per 10 cm dish. Three 10cm dishes were transfected with NSC siRNA whereas three other dishes were transfected with either siP1_1, siP2_1 or siP2_4 siRNAs as described in the transfections section. 48 h later cells were infected as described previously with DENV-2 (NGC strain) at MOI of 10 in a total volume of 10 ml, rocked every 15 minutes for 1 h and the infection was allowed to proceed for more 1.5 h (2.5 h total time). Cells were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen without cycloheximide pretreatment and cold lysis buffer containing CHX was used to lyse the cells on ice. The RIBOseq strategy was adapted from Ingolia and colleagues with a few modifications described next. After nuclease digestion, samples were run in a polysome gradient and the ribosome fractions were collected. As described by Reid and colleagues, fractions were extracted using Trizol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and rRNAs were removed using the Ribo-Zero gold rRNA removal kit (Illumina, San Diego CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For adapter ligation and library building we used NEBNext Small RNA Library Prep Set (Illumina)."

The human data have been submitted to the European Genome-Phenome Archive, ega-archive.org , EGA. The accession number for the human data is EGAS00001003263 and access is restricted and depends on a finalised Data Access Agreement, DAA. Furthermore, all study/publication related proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange (PRIDE) repository, under accession PXD012593 . The regulation of gene expression in human tissues is incompletely understood and has primarily been studied on the transcriptional level. Here, we quantify the impact of translation on gene expression and annotate novel translational events in 80 human hearts. These include 65 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) – the most common cause of heart transplantation – and 15 unaffected controls. We show that translational regulation modulates disease-associated molecular processes. Moreover, ribosome dynamics at protein truncating variants reveal incomplete termination of translation at DCM-causing titin-truncating variants. Finally, we identify dozens of unknown microproteins translated from lncRNAs and circRNAs and link these to mitochondrial processes. Several microproteins are expressed from lncRNAs with previously demonstrated function, suggesting a dual coding and noncoding role. This resource will stimulate novel functional investigations into human health and disease and may serve as a blueprint for characterizing the translational landscape of other human tissues."
PRJNA548813,Transcriptome and ribosome profiling of XRN1-null HEK293T human cell line generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing,"XRN1 is the major cytoplasmic exoribonuclease in eukaryotes, which degrades deadenylated and decapped mRNAs in the last step of the 5'–3' mRNA decay pathway. Metazoan XRN1 interacts with decapping factors coupling the final stages of decay. Ribosome profiling revealed that XRN1 loss impacts not only on mRNA levels but also on the translational efficiency of many cellular transcripts likely as a consequence of incomplete decay. We compared differentially expressed genes derived from the analysis of the transcriptome and the translatome of HEK293T wild-type (WT) and XRN1-null cells by RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq, respectively. Two biological replicates of each cell line were analyzed. The RNA-Seq analysis indicated that a substantial fraction of the total 10,105 genes showed significant differences between the two cell lines. 2,906 genes were significantly upregulated whilst 2,900 genes were downregulated using a fold change >0 on log2 scale with an FDR<0.005 to determine abundance. Significantly fewer genes showed differences between the WT and the XRN1-null cells at the level of translation with 433 genes showing an increase in abundance of ribosomal footprints whilst 560 genes were decreased as indicated by the Ribo-Seq analysis. Comparative analysis of translational efficiency (TE) in WT and XRN1-null cells on a genome-wide scale as a ratio of ribosomal occupancy to mRNA abundance identified an increase in TE for 102 genes but a decrease for 598 genes with most of the genes showing no evidence of change in the TE. Overall design: Two cell types with two biological replicates analysed using two methods."

PRJNA548091,Deficiency of mitoribosomal S10 protein affects translation and splicing in Arabidopsis mitochondria,"The ribosome is not only a protein-making machine, but also a regulatory element in protein synthesis. This view is supported by our earlier data showing that Arabidopsis mitoribosomes altered due to the silencing of the nuclear RPS10 gene encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein S10 differentially translate mitochondrial transcripts compared with the wild-type. Here, we used ribosome profiling to determine the contribution of transcriptional and translational control in the regulation of protein synthesis in rps10 mitochondria compared with the wild-type ones. Oxidative phosphorylation system proteins are preferentially synthesized in wild-type mitochondria but this feature is lost in the mutant. The rps10 mitoribosomes show slightly reduced translation efficiency of most respiration-related proteins and at the same time markedly more efficiently synthesize ribosomal proteins and MatR and TatC proteins. The mitoribosomes deficient in S10 protein protect shorter transcript fragments which exhibit a weaker 3-nucleotide periodicity compared with the wild-type. The decrease in the triplet periodicity is particularly drastic for genes containing introns. Notably, splicing is considerably less effective in the mutant, indicating an unexpected link between the deficiency of S10 and mitochondrial splicing. Thus, a shortage of the mitoribosomal S10 protein has wide-ranging consequences on mitochondrial gene expression. Overall design: Mitochondrial ribosome footprints from youngest leaves of 9-10 week-old wildtype or P2 and P3 phenotypes of heterozygous rps10 mutant"

Our results establish an unprecedentedly comprehensive protein acetylome in plants and reveal that HDA714 is a major deacetylase targeting a large number of Kac sites on hundreds of proteins of diverse function. We show that HDA714-dependent deacetylation is required for glycolytic activity, ribosome translational function, and plant growth and development. Our data uncovers novel regulators of protein Kac homeostasis in plants and extends the role of protein Kac in gene expression to translational regulation."
PRJNA545625,Suppression of ribosomal pausing by eIF5A is necessary to maintain the fidelity of start codon selection (Ribosome profiling),"Sequences within 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) dictate the site and efficiency of translation initiation. In this study, an unbiased screen designed to interrogate the 5' UTR-mediated regulation of the growth-promoting gene MYC unexpectedly revealed the ribosomal pause-relief factor eIF5A as a regulator of translation initiation codon selection. Depletion of eIF5A enhanced upstream translation within 5' UTRs across yeast and human transcriptomes, including on the MYC transcript where this resulted in increased production of an N-terminally extended protein. Furthermore, ribosome profiling experiments established that the function of eIF5A as a suppressor of ribosomal pausing at sites of suboptimal peptide bond formation is conserved in human cells. We present evidence that proximal ribosomal pausing on a transcript triggers enhanced usage of upstream suboptimal or non-canonical initiation codons. Thus, we propose that eIF5A functions not only to maintain efficient translation elongation in eukaryotic cells, but also to maintain the fidelity of translation initiation. Overall design: Ribosome profiling (and complementary RNA-sequencing) was performed in HCT116 cells that received, via lentivirus, Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting either EIF5A, DOHH or non-targeting control sgRNAs.

PRJNA545050,"Control of human hemoglobin switching by LIN28B-mediated regulation of BCL11A translation (Ribo-seq, RNA-seq)","While BCL11A protein is not well synthesized at these earlier stages of development, its mRNA curiously continues to be associated with ribosomes. Through unbiased proteomic analyses in erythroid cells, we demonstrate that the RNA-binding protein LIN28B, which is developmentally expressed in a reciprocal pattern to BCL11A, directly interacts with ribosomes. We show that the observed suppression of BCL11A protein translation is mediated by LIN28B through a direct interaction with BCL11A mRNA and independent of its role in let-7 microRNA biogenesis. Finally, we show that BCL11A is the major functional target in LIN28B-mediated fetal hemoglobin induction. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated regulatory mechanism underlying human hemoglobin switching and illuminate opportunities for developing improved treatments for sickle cell disease and Beta-thalassemia Overall design: Four replicates of ribosome profiling in adult and newborn erythroid cells with matching RNA-seq per sample."

Here, we exploit a systematic CRISPR-based screening strategy to identify hundreds of non-canonical CDSs that are essential for cellular growth and whose disruption elicit specific, robust transcriptomic and phenotypic changes in human cells. Functional characterization of the encoded microproteins reveals distinct cellular localizations, specific protein binding partners, and hundreds that are presented by the HLA system. Interestingly, we find multiple microproteins encoded in upstream open reading frames, which form stable complexes with the main, canonical protein encoded on the same mRNA, thus revealing the diverse use of functional bicistronic operons in mammals. Together, our results point to a family of functional human microproteins that play critical and diverse cellular roles. Overall design: Paired RNA-seq and ribosome profiling sequencing data for human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes,  either with or without the translational inhibitor harringtonine.

PRJNA543493,The Ccr4-Not complex monitors the translating ribosome for codon optimality,"Control of messenger RNA (mRNA) decay rate is intimately connected to translation elongation, but the spatial coordination of these events is poorly understood. The Ccr4-Not complex initiates mRNA decay through deadenylation and activation of decapping. We used a combination of cryo–electron microscopy, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays to examine the recruitment of Ccr4-Not to the ribosome via specific interaction of the Not5 subunit with the ribosomal E-site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This interaction occurred when the ribosome lacked accommodated A-site transfer RNA, indicative of low codon optimality. Loss of the interaction resulted in the inability of the mRNA degradation machinery to sense codon optimality. Our findings elucidate a physical link between the Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome and provide mechanistic insight into the coupling of decoding efficiency with mRNA stability.

We find that between 40°C and 42°C there is a shift in gene expression from the expression of genes harboring long and structured 5'UTRs to the expression of genes harboring thranscripts with short and unstructure 5'UTRs. We performed these experiments for WT yeast cells as well as for mutant yeast cells in which the RNA helicase Ded1 condensates at lower temperatures (Ded1-IDRm). We find upon comparing mutant and WT cells at 42°C, that Ded1-IDRm has increased expression of genes harboring unstructured 5'UTRs and decreased expression of genes harboring structured 5'UTRs.

PRJNA542722,Fidelity of translation initiation is required for coordinated respiratory complex assembly,"Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes are unique molecular machines that translate 11 leaderless mRNAs. To date it is not clear how mitoribosomes recognize and initiate translation in the absence of untranslated regions in the mitochondrial mRNAs. Translation initiation in mitochondria shares similarities with prokaryotic systems, such as the formation of a ternary complex of fMet-tRNAMet, mRNA and the 28S subunit, but differs in the requirements for initiation factors. Mitochondria have two initiation factors, MTIF2 that closes the decoding centre and stabilizes the binding of the fMet-tRNAMet to the leaderless mRNAs, and MTIF3 whose role is not clear. We knocked out Mtif3 in mice and show that this protein is essential for embryo development and heart- and skeletal muscle-specific loss of MTIF3 causes premature death. We identify increased but uncoordinated mitochondrial protein synthesis in mice lacking MTIF3 that results in loss of specific respiratory complexes. Therefore, we show that coordinated assembly of OXPHOS complexes requires stoichiometric levels of nuclear and mitochondrially-encoded protein subunits in vivo. Our ribosome profiling and transcriptomic analyses show that MTIF3 is required for recognition and regulation of translation initiation of mitochondrial mRNAs, but not dissociation of the ribosome subunits. Overall design: Total RNA was isolated from heart tissue from 25 week old control (Mtif3loxP/loxP) and Mtif3 knockout mice (Mtif3loxP/loxP, +/Ckmm), and TruSeq libraries produced, sequenced and analysed for differential expression. Sucrose gradient fractions of mitochondrial RNA corresponding to small and large subunit, as well as assembled ribosomes, was isolated from heart tissue from 25 week old control (Mtif3loxP/loxP) and Mtif3 knockout mice (Mtif3loxP/loxP, +/Ckmm), and ribosome profiling libraries produced and sequenced."

PRJNA542601,Ribosome profiling of eIF3e-KD MCF-10a cells,"eIF3 is a multi-subunit complex thought to execute numerous functions in canonical translation initiation, including mRNA recruitment to the 40S ribosome, scanning for the start codon, and inhibition of 60S subunit joining 1–3. eIF3 was also found to interact with 40S and 60S ribosomal proteins and translation elongation factors 4, but a direct involvement in translation elongation has never been demonstrated. Using selective ribosome profiling, we made the unexpected observation that eIF3 remains bound to post-initiation 80S ribosomes, followed by release after translation of ~50 codons. Furthermore, eIF3 deficiency reduces early ribosomal elongation speed, particularly on mRNAs encoding proteins associated with membrane-associated functions, resulting in defective synthesis of their encoded proteins and abnormal mitochondrial and lysosomal physiology.  Accordingly, heterozygous eIF3e+/- knockout mice accumulate giant mitochondria in skeletal muscle and show a progressive decline in muscle strength with age. Hence, in addition to its canonical role in translation initiation, eIF3 interacts with 80S ribosomes to enhance, at the level of early elongation, the synthesis of proteins with membrane-associated functions, an activity that is critical for normal muscle health. Overall design: Using si-RNA to do eIF3e-KD then do the ribosome profiling samples with total RNA, 3 replicates."

PRJNA540298,Multiplexed functional genomic analysis of somatic 5' untranslated region mutations across the spectrum of human prostate cancer (Ribosome Profiling),"The functional consequences of cancer patient-derived genetic variants within the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) on a genome-wide scale and their effects on mRNA transcript and translation levels are poorly understood. To systematically interrogate the mutational landscape of 5' UTRs across cancer patients with localized to metastatic disease, we analyzed the genomes of 226 prostate cancer patients and observed thousands of mutations, many of which impact known cis-regulatory elements. We developed a high-throughput multi-layer massively parallel sequencing-based method called PLUMAGE (Pooled full-length UTR Multiplex Assay on Gene Expression) to simultaneously quantify the effects of 545 5' UTR somatic mutations across recurrently mutated or cancer-related genes from our patient cohort. Our method enabled unprecedented insights into how 5' UTR mutations can control multiple levels of gene expression simultaneously. In particular, we identified 190 mutations that significantly altered 5' UTR function, either by creating new DNA binding elements, disrupting known translation regulatory motifs, or simultaneously impacting both transcript levels and mRNA translation. Furthermore, we also determined that 5' UTR mutations to the MAP kinase signaling pathway are significantly associated with early metastasis. This study is the first to comprehensively interrogate the functional 5' UTR mutational landscape of a human cancer revealing the importance of untranslated regions in regulating multiple levels of oncogenic gene expression and provides a high-throughput functional genomics solution applicable to many genetically driven diseases. Overall design: To investigate the functional impact of 5' UTR mutations in advanced prostate cancer, we will conduct whole exome sequencing utilizing new 5' UTR exon capture technology on a cohort of end stage castration resistant prostate cancer patient derived xenografts (PDXs). Derived from rapid autopsy specimens, these PDX models have never been cultured, faithfully recapitulate human disease, and represent a nearly inexhaustible supply of tissues for biological replicates. A number of 5' UTR somatic mutations, insertions, and deletions were identified. To directly correlate these findings with the translation of specific transcripts genome-wide, we will perform ribosome profiling on biological replicates of the same PDXs. Normal human prostate tissue will also be profiled as a comparison to expression in prostate cancer. This will be the very first functional analysis of the 5' UTR regulome in a human cancer."
PRJNA534111,Effect of adat2 silencing in Neurospora crassa on translation kinetics and transcriptome,"The silencing of tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase adat2 in Neurospora crassa abolished most of the I34 modification, resulting in major tRNA profile changes. The adat2 silencing caused genome-wide codon usage-biased ribosome pausing on mRNAs corresponding to changes in the tRNA profile, which reprograms translation elongation kinetics on ADAT-related codons. The ribosome profiling in this study was used to measure the effect of defective I34 modification of the eight tRNAs on translation kinetics during elongation stage. The accompanying mRNA-seq was used to normalize the ribosome profiling data using the same library construction protocol (reference to ARTseq™ Ribosome Profiling Kit (Catalog Number: RPYSC12116)) under the same growth condition. The independent mRNA-seq was used to measure the effect of I34 abolishment on transcriptome change using standard Illumina protocols. Meanwhile, to isolate the role of codon usage in translation elongation and protein level changes when adat2 is silenced, the independent mRNA-seq was also used to exclude the effect of mRNA level changes.

Few introns are detectable outside the nucleus. To hunt for interesting new phenomena in cytoplasmic introns and splicing, we conducted a multimodal study of total RNA within projections (axons, dendrites, glial projections) of rat hippocampal neurons and discovered a class of free circular introns enriched in distal projections. Overall design: A variety of sequencing datasets from rat primary hippocampal neurons are provided: From physically separated cellular projections and whole-cell lysates, (a) rRNA-depleted total RNA-seq (5 biological replicates, each) and (b) polyA site sequencing or PAS-seq (3 biological replicates, each); from fractionated cytoplasmic lysate (c) ribosome profiling (3 biological replicates) and (d) polyA+ RNA-seq (3 biological replicates)."

PRJNA533074,Ribo-seq of Toxoplasma-infected host cells,"Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous obligate intracellular parasite that infects the nucleated cells of warm-blooded animals. From within the parasitophorous vacuole in which they reside, Toxoplasma tachyzoites secrete an arsenal of effector proteins that can reprogram host gene expression to facilitate parasite survival and replication. Gaining a better understanding of how host gene expression is altered upon infection is central for understanding parasite strategies for host invasion and for developing new parasite therapies. Here, we applied ribosome profiling coupled with mRNA measurements to concurrently study gene expression in the parasite and in host human foreskin fibroblasts. By examining the parasite transcriptome and translatome, we identified potential upstream open reading frames that may permit the stress-induced preferential translation of parasite mRNAs. We also determined that tachyzoites reduce host death-associated pathways and increase survival, proliferation, and motility in both quiescent and proliferative host cell models of infection. Additionally, proliferative cells alter their gene expression in ways consistent with massive transcriptional rewiring while quiescent cells were best characterized by re-entry into the cell cycle. We also identified a translational control regimen consistent with mTOR activation in quiescent cells, and to a lesser degree in proliferative cells. This study illustrates the utility of the method for dissection of gene expression programs simultaneously in parasite and host.

Our analysis identified gene signatures that vary in a coordinated manner across cell types and gene sets that are regulated in a cell-type specific manner, even at times in opposite directions. These data reveal that aging, rather than inducing a universal program, drives a distinct transcriptional course in each cell population, and they highlight key molecular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, underlying brain aging. Overall, these large-scale datasets provide a resource for the neuroscience community that will facilitate additional discoveries directed towards understanding and modifying the aging process.

PRJNA530968,Splicing modulators elicit global translational repression by condensate-prone proteins translated from introns,"Chemical splicing modulators that bind to the spliceosome have provided an attractive venue for cancer treatment. Splicing modulators induce accumulation and subsequent translation of a subset of intron-retained mRNAs. Yet, the biological effect of proteins containing translated intron sequences remains unclear. Here we identified a number of truncated proteins generated upon treatment with the splicing modulator spliceostatin A (SSA) using genome-wide ribosome profiling and bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino-acid tagging (BONCAT) mass spectrometry. A subset of these truncated proteins has intrinsically disordered regions, forms insoluble cellular condensates, and triggers the proteotoxic stress response through JNK phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting the mTORC1 pathway. In turn, this reduces global translation. These findings indicate that creating an overburden of condensate-prone proteins derived from introns represses translation and prevents further production of harmful truncated proteins. This mechanism appears to contribute to the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity of splicing modulators. Overall design: Broadly, the objective of the study is to understand how cells cope with the aberrant splicing. We sought for the fates of each transcripts upon splicing modulation by a small molecule compound, spliceostatin A (SSA). Also, SSA is antitumor compound but the reason for the selective killing of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo has been unrevealed. Our study provides insight over it as well. we treated the HeLa S3 cells with either 100ng/mL SSA or two replicates with methanol (MeOH) (solvent for SSA as negative control) for 6 hours. Same cell lysate was simultaneously used to prepare RNA-seq and Ribosome profiling libraries."

PRJNA530508,m6A in mRNA coding regions promotes translation via the RNA helicase-containing YTHDC2,"Dynamic mRNA modification in the form of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) adds considerable richness and sophistication to gene regulation. The m6A mark is asymmetrically distributed along mature mRNAs, with a strong preference around the stop codon and 3'UTR. Nevertheless, approximately 35% of m6A residues are located within the coding region (CDS). It has been suggested that methylation in CDS slows down translation elongation by interfering the decoding process. However, neither the decoding feature of endogenous mRNAs nor the physiological significance of CDS m6A has been clearly defined. By integrating Ribo-seq and m6A-seq data sets, we found that CDS m6A methylation leads to ribosome pausing in a codon-specific manner. Unexpectedly, removing CDS m6A modification from these transcripts results in a further decrease of translation. A systemic analysis of RNA structural datasets revealed that CDS m6A methylation positively regulates translation by resolving mRNA secondary structures. We further demonstrate that the elongation-promoting effect of CDS methylation requires the RNA helicase-containing m6A reader YTHDC2. Our findings established the physiological significance of CDS methylation and uncovered non-overlapping function of m6A reader proteins. Overall design: Using Ribo-seq to investigate the effect of m6A/m6A reader on translation efficiency"
PRJNA530200,Cue2 and Slh1 define parallel pathways to rescue stalled ribosomes,"Ribosome stalling at problematic sequences in mRNAs leads to collisions that trigger a collection of quality control events including ribosome rescue, targeting the nascent polypeptide for decay (Ribosome-mediated Quality Control or RQC), and targeting of the mRNA for decay (No Go Decay or NGD). Using a reverse genetic screen in yeast, we identify Cue2 as the endonuclease that is recruited to stalled ribosomes to promote NGD. Following Cue2-mediated cleavage, ribosomes upstream of the cleavage site translate to the end of the truncated mRNA and are rescued by the Dom34:Hbs1 complex. We also show that the putative helicase Slh1 (part of the RQC Trigger or RQT complex) removes collided ribosomes behind the lead stalled ribosome and thereby reduces endonucleolytic cleavage by Cue2. The synergistic activities of Cue2 and Slh1 define two parallel pathways that allow cells to recognize and respond to ribosomes trapped on problematic mRNAs. Overall design: 7 samples for ribosome profiling experiments using various yeast strains and 3 samples for in vitro ribosome footprinting experiments using isloated trisomes from sucrose gradients."

PRJNA529461,Developmental changes of rRNA ribose methylations in the mouse,"A sequencing-based profiling method (RiboMeth-seq) for ribose methylations was used to study methylation patterns in mouse adult tissues and during development. In contrast to previous reports based on studies of human cancer cell lines, almost all methylation sites were close to fully methylated in adult tissues. A subset of sites was differentially modified in developing tissues compared to their adult counterparts and showed clear developmental dynamics. This provides the first evidence for ribosome heterogeneity at the level of rRNA modifications during mouse development. In a prominent example, the expression levels of SNORD78 during development appeared to be regulated by alternative splicing of the Gas5 host-gene and to correlate with the methylation level of its target site at LSU-G4593. The results are discussed in the context of the specialized ribosome hypothesis. Overall design: 11 samples analyzed in biological triplicates, in total 33 samples"

To better understand the response mechanisms and evolutionary history of gene family member regulation across angiosperm phyla, we studied the rapid submergence response of rice, the legume Medicago truncatula, and two Solanum species, domesticated tomato (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and its dryland-adapted wild relative S. pennellii. Response to hypoxic conditions was measured by analyzing transcriptional and post-translational regulation in root tips of each species. This was achieved by the use of Nuclei Tagged in specific Cell Types (INTACT) and Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification to obtain chromatin and sub-populations of gene transcripts. (1) Chromatin accessibility was evaluated by coupling INTACT with ATAC-seq (assay for Transposon-Accessible Chromatin). (2) INTACT was used to capture nuclear RNA (nRNA). (3) Polyadenylated mRNA (polyA RNA) was obtained by standard oligo(dT) selection. (4)  Ribosome-associated polyA mRNA (polyA RNA) was obtained by use of Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP).  Ribosome footprinting (Ribo-seq) was accomplished by using TRAP to capture ribosome protected fragments after RNAseI digestion. Samples evaluated include the apical root tip (four species) and shoot region (Solanum species only) under control conditions and after 2 h of submergence Overall design: 5 genotypes (Oryza sativa, Medicago truncatula-hairy root, Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum lycopersicum-hairy root and Solanum pennellii ), 2 conditions (control and 2 hour-submerged tissue grown on petri dishes with 1X MS, 1 % [w/v] Sucrose, pH 5.8). 4 bioreplicates of 4 RNA pools (total mRNA, rRNA degraded nuclear RNA, TRAP-RNA, Riboseq-RNA) and ATAC-seq.

PRJNA528192,Ribosomal protein S7 ubiquitination during ER stress in yeast is associated with selective mRNA translation and stress outcome.,"eIF2a phosphorylation-mediated translational regulation is crucial for global translation repression by various stresses, including the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, translational control during UPR has not been demonstrated in yeast. This study investigated ribosome ubiquitination-mediated translational controls during UPR. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress enhanced the levels of ubiquitination of the ribosomal proteins uS10, uS3 and eS7. Not4-mediated monoubiquitination of eS7A was required for resistance to tunicamycin, whereas E3 ligase Hel2-mediated ubiquitination of uS10 was not. Ribosome profiling showed that the monoubiquitination of eS7A was crucial for translational regulation, including the upregulation of the spliced form of HAC1 (HAC1i) mRNA and the downregulation of Histidine triad NucleoTide-binding 1 (HNT1) mRNA. Downregulation of the deubiquitinating enzyme complex Upb3-Bre5 increased the levels of ubiquitinated eS7A during UPR in an Ire1-independent manner. These findings suggest that the monoubiquitination of ribosomal protein eS7A plays a crucial role in translational controls during the ER stress response in yeast. Overall design: 2~4 different Tm treatment in 3 different strains. 1µg/ml Tunicamycin (Tm) was added into the growing cell culture at log phase, and harvested the cell at the following time points. WT cells were harvested at 0, 1, 2, 4 hour after Tunicamycin treatment. eS7-WT and eS7-4KR cells were harvested at 0 and 4 hour after Tunicamycin treatment."
PRJNA528026,Ribosome profiling in RPEI cells upon CDK1-inhibition,"Protein synthesis is the second most energy-intensive process in the cell. Therefore, cells tightly control mRNA translation rates in response to external stimuli (growth factors, differentiation signals) and the internal resources available (nutrients, energy). We set out to unravel new molecular mechanisms of global translation control required for cellular homeostasis. Using a siRNA screening approach to knock-down all human kinases and phosphatases, we analyzed the impact of protein phosphorylation on translation regulation in unstressed, proliferating cells. A visual screen was conducted to assess stress granule formation (as a consequence of translational shutdown) in the absence of 711 kinases and 256 phosphatases. Several candidates identified in the screen are linked, either directly or indirectly, to cell cycle regulation. We further identified a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), whose genetic downregulation or chemical inhibition results in global translation suppression. In order to assess CDK downstream signaling, we performed phosphoproteomics analysis and found the phosphorylation status of many ribosomal proteins to be altered upon CDK inhibition. Indeed, we could show that S6-kinase 1 partially contributes to CDK-dependent translational control. Ribosome profiling further revealed that the translation of 5'TOP mRNAs, including many mRNAs encoding for ribosomal proteins, is especially sensitive to CDK inhibition. While the translation regulatory function of this kinase is independent of the cell cycle phase, its activity is ideally suited to couple the overall proliferation rate of cells to the global rate of protein synthesis. Our results identify a pathway that enables cells to directly adapt protein homeostasis to proliferation and growth signals. Overall design: RO-3306 or DMSO treated RPEI cells were subjected to ribosome profiling in three biological replicates. As a spike-in to detect global changes in translation efficiency, S. cerevisiae lysate was added to the RPEI lysates. To determine ribosome densities, both ribosome protected fragments and alkaline-fragmented input material were analyzed, amounting to 12 samples in total."

PRJNA525090,Cellular gene expression during Hepatitis C Virus replication revealed by Ribosome profiling,"Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects human liver hepatocytes, often leading to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is believed that chronic infection alters host gene expression and favours HCC development. In particular, HCV replication in Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) derived membranes induces chronic ER stress. How HCV replication affects host mRNA translation and transcription at a genome wide level is not yet known. Methods: We used Riboseq (Ribosome Profiling) to analyze transcriptome and translatome changes in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells replicating HCV for 6 days. Results: Established viral replication does not cause global changes in host gene expression - only around 30 genes are differentially expressed. Upregulated genes are related to ER stress, HCV replication and HCC development. Some mRNAs (PPP1R15A/GADD34, DDIT3/CHOP, TRIB3) may be subject to uORF mediated translation control in response to stress-induced eIF2 inactivation. Transcriptional downregulation mainly affects mitochondrial respiratory chain complex genes. Conclusion: After establishing HCV replication, cellular gene expression is reprogrammed towards stress response and HCC development. Downregulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain genes indicates how a virus induces cancer cell-like metabolic reprogramming (Warburg effect). Thus, HCV escapes stress response pathways but induces selective gene expression changes which likely are beneficial for chronic infection and cancerogenesis. Overall design: Transcriptome and translatome changes in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells replicating HCV for 6 days in comparison to non-infected cells were analyzed, in triplicates, by NGS."
PRJNA524965,Landscape and metabolism of cryptic unstable transcripts in human malaria parasites,"The highly tight regulation of gene expression plays a critical role in the development and pathogenesis of human malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum throughout the complex life cycle. Accumulated experimental data reveals nascent transcripts and non-coding RNAs have been involved in the regulation of virulence gene expression, suggesting a hidden transcriptome composed of nascent message RNAs and non-coding cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) contributes to post-transcriptional regulation (PTR) of gene expression in this pathogen. Nevertheless, the source, dynamic transcription, metabolism and related biological functions of CUTs are still poorly investigated. Here we performed dynamic nascent RNA profiling by ribosome RNA-depleted and strand-specific RNA sequencing in 48-hour intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC). Our data revealed the dynamics of post- transcriptionally regulated genes, and genome-wide sources of 2252 CUTs, mostly originating from intergenic regions and untranslated regions of annotated genes including var gene family. By utilizing transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, we systematically defined the local euchromatin-like environment where those newly identified CUTs originated, and revealed a significantly positive correlation between CUTs and corresponding mRNA abundance. Finally, we showed the cooperation of RNA exosome catalytic subunit PfDis3 and its cofactor PfMtr4 played a major role in CUTs degradation. Collectively, this study provides new insight into the potential regulatory functions of short-lived CUTs, which would contribute to our understanding of the complex mechanism of gene expression in P. falciparum."
PRJEB21199,Adaptive laboratory evolution of a genome-reduced Escherichia coli,"Genome-reduced bacteria supply only the genes necessary and sufficient for full functionality, allowing the potential for redesigning biological systems with desirable properties. However, nonessential gene removal often impairs growth. To increase fitness, genome-reduced Escherichia coli was subjected to adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE). Upon parental strain-equivalent growth rate restoration, additional unique physiological behaviors indicated significant ALE-driven metabolic and regulatory perturbations. Genomic change dynamics over 800 generations elucidated the underlying genetic basis was primarily transcription machinery-based gene expression reprogramming. These mutations were dramatically induced by MutHLS DNA repair system spontaneous inactivation. With appropriate biosynthesis resource availability, the evolved genome-reduced strain exhibited higher translation efficiency via ribosome profiling than wild-type E. coli for protein synthesis. This comprehensive genetic information will provide the foundation for redesigning artificial minimal genomes."

Translational profiles of a nonmalignant (Human Mammary Epithelial Cells, HMECs) and a nontumorigenic (MCF10A cells) counterparts were also analyzed. We analyzed and compared translational efficiencies, variances of the translational efficiencies, differential gene and transcript expression between malignant and non-malignant cell lines. We performed discriminative motif analysis of the 5'untranslated regions of the transcripts that are commonly transcribed in nonmalignant and malignant cells but preferentially translated in malignant cells and identified common motifs. Some of these motifs are highly similar to the RNA binding motifs of a small list of RNA interacting proteins. This approach led us to identify SRSF1 as an RNA binding protein commonly expressed among all analyzed cell lines that has a pervasive impact on the translational landscape of a representative estrogen receptor-positive and -negative cell line Overall design: Ribosome profiling of 6 different cell lines in at least 2 biological replicates"

PRJNA521751,Divergent effects of eRF3 and Upf1 on the expression of uORF carrying mRNAs and ribosome protein genes,"In addition to its role in translation termination, eRF3 has been implicated in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway through its interaction with Upf1. NMD is a RNA quality control mechanism, which detects and degrades aberrant mRNAs as well as some normal transcripts including those that harbor upstream open reading frames in their 5' leader sequence and long 3' UTR. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to perform a genome wide analysis of the effect of either eRF3 or Upf1 depletion in human cells. Our bioinformatics analyses allow to delineate the features of the transcripts controlled by eRF3 and Upf1 and to compare the effect of each of these factors on gene expression. We show that eRF3 and Upf1 have very different impact on the human transcriptome, only ~250 transcripts being targeted by both factors. We also show that in contrast to Upf1, eRF3a depletion globally derepressed the expression of mRNAs containing translated uORFs. Finally, we find that eRF3a and Upf1 have opposite effects on ribosome protein gene expression. Together, our results provide important elements for understanding the impact of translation termination and NMD on the human transcriptome and reveal novel determinants of ribosome biogenesis regulation.

While the regulation of ribosome elongation is well studied in bacteria and yeast, less is known in higher eukaryotes. Here, we combined ribosome and tRNA profiling to investigate the relations between ribosome elongation rates, (aminoacyl-) tRNA levels and codon usage in mammals. We modeled codon-specific ribosome dwell times and translation fluxes from ribosome profiling, considering pair-interactions between ribosome sites.  In mouse liver, the model revealed site and codon specific dwell times, as well as codon pair-interactions clustering by amino acids.

PRJNA521496,Selective translation mechanism through two paralogs of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A,"Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A is a DEAD-box RNA-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in translation initiation. Although mammals have two eIF4A paralogs, eIF4A1 and eIF4A2, their redundancy has been long assumed because of high homology and their functional difference has been poorly understood. Here we show that eIF4A paralogs employ differential translation programs. Ribosome profiling of eIF4A1- and eIF4A2-knockout HEK293T cell lines revealed that translation efficiency changes were divergent across transcriptome and distinct group of mRNAs were regulated by each paralog.

PRJNA521364,Suppressor mutations in ribosomal proteins and FliY restore Bacillus subtilis swarming motility in the absence of EF-P [Ribosome Profiling],"Translation elongation factor P (EF-P) alleviates ribosome pausing at a subset of motifs encoding consecutive proline residues and is required for growth in many organisms. Here we show that Bacillus subtilis EF-P also alleviated ribosome pausing at sequences encoding tandem prolines, and ribosomes paused within several essential genes without a corresponding growth defect in an efp mutant. The B. subtilis efp mutant is instead impaired for flagellar biosynthesis which results in the abrogation of a form of motility called swarming. We isolate swarming suppressors of efp and identify mutations in 8 genes that suppressed the efp mutant swarming defect, many of which encode conserved ribosomal proteins or ribosome-associated factors. One mutation abolished a translational pause site within the flagellar C-ring component FliY to increase flagellar number and restore swarming motility in the absence of EF-P. Our data support a model wherein EF-P-alleviation of ribosome pausing may be particularly important for macromolecular assemblies like the flagellum that require precise protein stoichiometries. Overall design: 4 Bacillus subtilis strains with 3 biological replicates each were analyzed. DK1042 is the wild type and parent strain."
PRJNA521077,RNA-seq and ribosome footprint profiling of human and mouse platelets with sepsis,"There is increasing recognition that platelets have a functional role in the pathophysiology of sepsis though have not been precisely defined. Whether sepsis alters the human platelet transcriptome and translational landscape has never been established. We utilized parallel techniques of RNA-sequencing and ribosome footprint profiling to interrogate the platelet transcriptome and translatome in septic patients and healthy donors. We identified 1,806 significantly differentially expressed (FDR<0.05) transcripts in platelets from septic patients. Translational events in platelets during sepsis were also upregulated. To explore relevance of murine model of sepsis, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) we compared sepsis-induced changes in platelet gene expression between septic patients and CLP-treated mice. Platelet transcriptional (rho=0.42, p=3.2x10-285) and translational (0.65, p=1.09x10-56) changes were significantly correlated between septic patients and mice. We focused on ITGA2B, tracking and validating the expression, regulation, and functional impact of changes in ITGA2B during sepsis. ITGA2B expression was significantly upregulated in human and murine platelets during sepsis. Increased ITGA2B was identified in bone marrow megakaryocytes within 24 hours of sepsis onset, with subsequent trafficking to platelets at 72 hours. Transcriptional changes in ITGA2B were accompanied by de novo protein synthesis of ?IIb and integrin ?IIb?3 activation. Increased ?IIb was associated with mortality in humans and mice. These findings provide previously unrecognized evidence that human and murine sepsis similarly alters the platelet transcriptional and translational landscape. Moreover, ITGA2B is upregulated and functional in sepsis due to trafficking from megakaryocytes and de novo synthesis in platelets, and is associated with increased mortality."

Here we show that methylated mRNAs are catalysts for liquid-liquid phase separation of the YTHDF family of m6A-binding proteins. RNAs that contain multiple, but not single, m6A residues recruit multiple YTHDF proteins, causing them to undergo a proximity-induced phase separation. YTHDF proteins show liquid-like properties upon binding polymethylated mRNAs in cells, and partition into endogenous phase-separated compartments, such as P-bodies, neuronal RNA granules, and stress granules. The complexes of YTHDF proteins and polymethylated mRNAs are targeted to different compartments depending on the cell context, leading to different effects on m6A mRNAs. These studies reveal a role for nucleotide modifications in regulating phase separation and indicate that the cellular properties of m6A-modified mRNAs can be explained by liquid-liquid phase separation principles. Overall design: RNA-seq was performed on wild type and Mettl14 -/- mouse embryonic stem cells. Four replicates were sequenced under non-stressed conditions, after heat shock at 42°C for 30 min, and 1 h after recovery from heat shock stress."
PRJNA517165,"Transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood NK cells of chronic HBV, HCV and HIV patients","Background: NK cells during chronic viral infection have been well studied over the last decade. We performed an unbiased next-generation RNA-sequencing approach to identify commonalities or differences of the effect of HIV, HCV and HBV viremia on NK cell transcriptomes. Methods: Using cell sorting, we obtained CD3-CD56+ NK cells from blood of 6 HIV, 11 HCV, and 32 HBV infected and untreated patients. Library preparation and sequencing were done using Illumina mRNA-Seq Sample Prep Kit and the HiSeq 2000, HiSeq2500 or NextSeq 500, and further analysis by an in-house analytic pipeline. Results: In NK cells from HIV, HCV and HBV patients, transcriptome analysis identified 272, 53, and 56 differentially expressed genes, respectively (fold change >1.5, q-value 0.2). Interferon stimulated genes were induced in NK cells from HIV/HCV patients, but not during HBV infection. HIV viremia downregulated ribosome assembly genes in NK cells. In HBV, viral load and ALT variation had little effect on genes related to NK effector function. Conclusion: We compare, for the first time, NK cell transcripts of viremic HIV, HCV and HBV patients. We clearly demonstrate distinctive NK cell gene signatures in 3 different populations, suggestive for a different degree of functional alterations of the NK cell compartment as compared to healthy individuals. Overall design: We analyzed NK cell transcripts collected from the blood of well-characterized chronic HBV patients (n=32), chronic HCV patients (n=8), and HIV patients (n=6). Differential gene expression analysis, global module analysis, and unsupervised clustering analysis were performed by employing RNA-sequencing on blood NK cell transcriptomes."
PRJNA515538,Accurate annotation of human protein-coding small open reading frames,"Protein-coding small open reading frames (smORFs) are emerging as an important class of genes, however, the coding capacity of smORFs in the human genome is unclear. By integrating de novo transcriptome assembly and Ribo-Seq, we confidently annotate thousands of novel translated smORFs in three human cell lines. We find that smORF translation prediction is noisier than for annotated coding sequences, underscoring the importance of analyzing multiple experiments and footprinting conditions. These smORFs are located within non-coding and antisense transcripts, the UTRs of mRNAs, and unannotated transcripts. Analysis of RNA levels and translation efficiency during cellular stress identifies regulated smORFs and provides an approach for identifying smORFs for further investigation. Sequence conservation and signatures of positive selection indicate that encoded microproteins are likely functional. Additionally, proteomics data from enriched human leukocyte antigen complexes validates the translation of hundreds of smORFs and positions them as a source of novel antigens. Thus, smORFs represent a significant number of important, yet unexplored human genes. Overall design: Annotation of protein-coding smORFs in 3 human cell lines using de novo transcriptome assembly and Ribo-Seq."

PRJNA515197,Ribosome queuing enables non-AUG translation to be resistant to multiple protein synthesis inhibitors,"Aberrant translation initiation at non-AUG start codons is associated with multiple cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, how non-AUG translation is regulated differently from canonical translation is poorly understood. We thus used start codon-selective  reporters and ribosome profiling to characterize how translation from non-AUG start codons responds to protein synthesis inhibitors in human cells. These analyses surprisingly revealed that translation of non-AUG reporters and the endogenous GUG-encoded DAP5 (eIF4G2/p97) mRNA are resistant to cycloheximide (CHX), a translation inhibitor which slows but does not completely abrogate elongation. Our data suggest that slowly elongating ribosomes cause queuing of scanning pre-initiation complexes (PIC), preferentially enhancing otherwise poor recognition of non-AUG start codons. Consistent with this model, limiting PIC formation or scanning sensitizes non-AUG translation to CHX. Moreover, PIC queuing can cause translation from an AUG codon in a poor context to become less sensitive to CHX. We further find that non-AUG translation is resistant to other inhibitors that target ribosomes within the coding sequence, but not those targeting newly initiated ribosomes. In total, these data indicate that ribosome queuing enables mRNAs with poor initiation context, namely those from non-AUG start codons, to be resistant to pharmacological inhibitors. Overall design: Measuring translational efficiency genome-wide in response to prolonged cyclohexamide treatment"
PRJNA515049,Cycloheximide can distort measurements of mRNA levels and translation efficiency,"Regulation of the efficiency with which an mRNA is translated into proteins represents a key mechanism for controlling gene expression. Such regulation impacts the number of actively translating ribosomes per mRNA molecule, referred to as translation efficiency (TE), which can be monitored using ribosome profiling and RNA-seq, or by evaluating the position of an mRNA in a polysome gradient. Here we show that in budding yeast, under nutrient limiting conditions, the commonly used translation inhibitor cycloheximide induces rapid transcriptional upregulation of hundreds of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. Cycloheximide also prevents translation of these newly transcribed messages, leading to an apparent drop in TE of these genes under conditions that include key transitions of the yeast metabolic cycle, meiosis, and amino acid starvation; an effect which is abolished when cycloheximide pretreatment is omitted.  This response requires TORC1 signaling, and is modulated by the genetic background as well as the vehicle used to deliver the drug. The present work highlights an important caveat to the use of translation inhibitors when measuring TE, and will hopefully aid in future experimental design as well as interpretation of prior results Overall design: Paired RNA-seq and ribosome profiling sequencing data for 28 yeast samples in various growth conditions, either with or without cycloheximide pretreatment"

Overall design: Promixal tubule was profiled by Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP)"
PRJNA514710,The landscape of mRNA translation in tomato roots,"We used Ribo-seq (Ribosome profiling) combining with RNA-seq to explore the translational landscape of tomato roots. We generated three biological replicates of RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data for tomato roots. We next used the RNA-seq result for de novo transcriptome assembly and Ribo-seq to identify novel translated open reading frames (ORFs). Our data revealed more than three hundreds of novel translated ORFs on previously unannotated transcripts. Most of the newly identified ORFs are small and difficult to detect with in silico methods. We also identified over thirteen hundreds of upstream ORFs on annotated genes. This data could facilitate gene annotation. Besides, this data also demonstrated that uORFs, miRNAs and antisense RNAs are regulating the expression of associated genes. This study uncovered mechanisms of translational regulation and gene annotation in tomato. Overall design: 3 biological replicates of 4-day old tomato roots (about 2~3 cm from root tips) collected and processed for Ribo-seq and RNA-seq sample preparation. The Ribo-seq library was sequenced with illumina single-end 50 sequencing and the RNA-seq library was sequenced with illumina paired-end 100 sequencing."

PRJNA513492,Charting DENR-dependent translation reinitiation uncovers predictive uORF features and links to circadian timekeeping via Clock,"The non-canonical initiation factor DENR promotes translation reinitiation on uORF-containing mRNAs. Moreover, DENR depletion shortens circadian period in mouse fibroblasts, suggesting that uORF usage and reinitiation regulate clock function. To identify DENR-regulated translation events transcriptome-wide and, in particular, specific core clock transcripts affected by this mechanism, we have used ribosome profiling in DENR-deficient NIH3T3 cells. We found 240 transcripts with altered translation rate, and used linear regression analysis to extract uORF features predictive of DENR dependance. Among core clock genes, we identified Clock as a DENR target. Using Clock 5'UTR mutants, we mapped the specific uORF through which DENR acts to regulate CLOCK protein biosynthesis. Notably, these experiments identified an alternative downstream start codon, which likely represents the true CLOCK N-terminus. Our findings provide insights into uORF-mediated translational regulation that can regulate the mammalian circadian clock and gene expression at large. Overall design: iCLIP experiments: Denr-overexpressing (OE) or non-transfected (NT) NIH3t3 cells were grown to subconfluency in 15 cm plates/replicate. Cells were crosslinked with UV-C (254 nm) at 150 mJ/cm2,prior to lysate preparation. RNA was partially digested, and DENR-RNA complexes were pulled down with anti-DENR antibody (pre-immobilised in protein G dynabeads). An infrarred adaptor was ligated in the 3' end of RNAs and complexes were visualised after PAGE and nitrocellulose transfer in a Licor machine. RNA-protein complexes of 60-130 Kda were excised and used for library preparation. 24 PCR cycles were used for final library amplification. An IgG immunoprecipitation was used as IP control."

PRJNA513069,Coordination of hunger and sleep through circadian regulation of transcription in energy-sensing neurons,"Alignment of fasting and feeding with the sleep/wake cycle is coordinated by hypothalamic neurons, though the underlying molecular programs remain incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that the clock transcription pathway maximizes eating during wakefulness and glucose production during sleep through transcription pathway maximizes eating during autonomous circadian regulation of NPY/AgRP neurons. Tandem profiling of whole cell and ribosome-bound mRNAs in morning and evening under dynamic fasting and fed conditions identified temporal control of activity-dependent gene repertoires in AgRP neurons central to synaptogenesis, bioenergetics, and neurotransmitter and peptidergic signaling. Synaptic and circadian pathways were specific to whole cell RNA analyses, while bioenergetic pathways were selectively enriched in the ribosome-bound transcriptome. Finally, we demonstrate that the AgRP clock mediates the transcriptional food acquisition with sleep/wake state. response to leptin. Our results reveal that time-of-day restriction in transcriptional control of energy-sensing neurons underlies the alignment of hunger and day restriction in transcriptional control of energy-sensing neurons underlies the alignment of hunger and food acquisition with sleep/wake state. Overall design: Examination of AGRP neurons including BMAL1-KO, under 3 different nutrient states, leptin adiministration, and time of day collection points."

PRJNA512837,Cellular proteostasis collapse in mammalian senescence,"Proteostasis collapse, the diminished ability to maintain protein homeostasis, has been established as a hallmark of nematode aging. However, whether proteostasis collapse occurs in humans has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that proteostasis decline is intrinsic to human senescence. Using transcriptome-wide characterization of gene expression, splicing, and translation, we found a significant deterioration in the transcriptional activation of the heat shock response in stressed senescent cells. Furthermore, phosphorylated HSF1 nuclear localization and distribution were impaired in senescence. Interestingly, alternative splicing regulation was also dampened. Surprisingly, we found a decoupling between different unfolded protein response (UPR) branches in stressed senescent cells. While young cells initiated UPR-related translational and transcriptional regulatory responses, senescent cells showed enhanced translational regulation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensing; however, they were unable to trigger UPR-related transcriptional responses. This was accompanied by diminished ATF6 nuclear localization in stressed senescent cells. Finally, we found that proteasome function was impaired following heat stress in senescent cells, and did not recover upon return to normal temperature. Together, our data unraveled a deterioration in the ability to mount dynamic stress transcriptional programs upon human senescence with broad implications on proteostasis control and connected proteostasis decline to human aging. Overall design: RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq for young and senescent WI-38 cells with and without heat shock"
PRJNA512491,Differential roles of human PUS10 in miRNA processing and tRNA pseudouridylation,"Pseudouridine synthases (PUSs) are responsible for the installation of pseudouridine (?) modification in RNA. However, the activity and function of the PUS enzymes remain largely unexplored. Here we focus on human PUS10 and find that it co-expresses with the microprocessor (DROSHA–DGCR8 complex). Depletion of PUS10 results in a marked reduction of the expression level of a large number of mature miRNAs and concomitant accumulation of unprocessed primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) in multiple human cells. Mechanistically, PUS10 directly binds to pri-miRNAs and interacts with the microprocessor to promote miRNA biogenesis. Unexpectedly, this process is independent of the catalytic activity of PUS10. Additionally, we develop a sequencing method to profile ? in the tRNAome and report PUS10-dependent ? sites in tRNA. Collectively, our findings reveal differential functions of PUS10 in nuclear miRNA processing and in cytoplasmic tRNA pseudouridylation. Overall design: DM-?-seq,  PolyA RNA-seq,  rRNA(-) nuclear RNA-seq, Ribo-seq of PUS10 knockout and wild-type HEK293T cells and PAR-CLIP-seq against PUS10 in HEK293T cells."
PRJNA511999,"A tRNA modification balances carbon and nitrogen metabolism by regulating phosphate homeostasis, to couple metabolism to cell cycle progression.","Cells must appropriately sense and integrate multiple metabolic resources to commit to proliferation. Here, we report that cells regulate nitrogen (amino acid) and carbon metabolic homeostasis through tRNA U34-thiolation. Despite amino acid sufficiency, tRNA-thiolation deficient cells appear amino acid starved. In these cells, carbon flux towards nucleotide synthesis decreases, and trehalose synthesis increases, resulting in metabolic a starvation-signature. Thiolation mutants have only minor translation defects. However, these cells exhibit strongly decreased expression of phosphate homeostasis genes, mimicking a phosphate-limited state. Reduced phosphate enforces a metabolic switch, where glucose-6-phosphate is routed towards storage carbohydrates. Notably, trehalose synthesis, which releases phosphate and thereby restores phosphate availability, is central to this metabolic rewiring. Thus, cells use thiolated tRNAs to perceive amino acid sufficiency, and balance amino acid and carbon metabolic flux to maintain metabolic homeostasis, by controlling phosphate availability. These results further biochemical explain how phosphate availability determines a switch to a 'starvation-state'. Overall design: Ribosome-footprinting and RNA-seq samples of  yeast CEN.PK, ?uba4 and ?ncs2 strains."
PRJNA511473,CERES is an eIF4E-interacting protein that forms non-canonical translation initiation complexes and modulates translation during the diel cycle in plants,"Translation is a fundamental step in gene expression that regulates multiple developmental and stress responses. One key step of translation is the association between eIF4E and eIF4G. This process is regulated in different eukaryotes by proteins which bind to eIF4E and block the formation of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex. Here, we report the discovery of CERES, the first functional eIF4E regulator described in plants. CERES is a modular protein that contains a LRR domain and a canonical eIF4E binding site (4E-BS), critical for CERES interaction with eIF4E in planta. CERES/eIF4E interaction excludes eIF4G from the complex. Despite this observation, CERES promotes translation in vivo interacts with eIF4A and with eIF3 in vivo and cosediments with translation initiation complexes in sucrose gradients. Moreover, ceres mutants display a sharp increase of the 80S peak and a reduction of polysome content at specific periods of the diel cycle. Super-resolution ribosome profiling demonstrates that these mutants show a change of translation efficiency of mRNAs related to light response and glucose management. Consistently, these mutants show a hypersensitive response to glucose. These data show that CERES is a “non canonical” translation initiation factor that, through the formation of alternative translation initiation complexes, modulates translation during the light cycle in plants. Overall design: Ribo-seq and RNA-seq of Arabidopsis Col-0 and ceres mutants. 3 replicates each."
PRJNA511455,The RNA-binding protein HuR is a negative regulator in adipogenesis [Ribo-seq_RNA-seq_matched],"Human antigen R (HuR) protein, a RNA binding protein (RBP), has been reported to  regulate essential steps in RNA metabolism and immune response in a variety of cell types,  but its function in metabolism remains unclear. This study identifies HuR as a major  repressor during adipogenesis. Knockdown and overexpression of HuR in primary adipocyte  culture enhances and inhibits adipogenesis in vitro, respectively. Fat-specific knockout of  HuR significantly enhances adipogenic gene program in all three major adipose tissues  including epidydimal, inguinal white and brown adipose tissue, accompanied with systemic  glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Conversely, transgenic overexpression of HuR in  adipose tissue prevents the HFD induced obesity by repressing adipogenesis.  Mechanistically, HuR may inhibit adipogenesis by recognizing and modulating the stability of  hundreds of adipocyte transcripts, including the mRNA of Insig1, a negative regulator during  adipogenesis. Taken together, our work establishes HuR as a novel posttranscriptional  regulator of adipogenesis and provides a new insight into how RNA processing contributes  to adipocyte development. Overall design: 8 samples were included. Duplicate of epididymal white fat from control and huR knockout animals were harvested for matched RNA-seq and RIBO-seq."
PRJNA510985,Hcr1/eIF3j is a 60S ribosomal subunit recycling accessory factor in vivo,"Hcr1/eIF3j is a sub-stoichiometric subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) that can dissociate the post-termination 40S ribosomal subunit from mRNA in vitro. We examined this ribosome recycling role in vivo by ribosome profiling and reporter assays and found that loss of Hcr1 led to reinitiation of translation in 3'UTRs, consistent with a defect in recycling. However, the defect appeared to be in recycling of the 60S subunit, rather than the 40S subunit, because reinitiation did not require an AUG codon and was suppressed by overexpression of the 60S dissociation factor Rli1/ABCE1. Consistent with a 60S recycling role, overexpression of Hcr1 could not compensate for loss of 40S recycling factors Tma64/eIF2D and Tma20/MCT-1. Intriguingly, loss of Hcr1 triggered higher expression of RLI1 via an apparent feedback loop. These findings suggest Hcr1/eIF3j is recruited to ribosomes at stop codons and may coordinate the transition to a new round of translation. Overall design: 25 biological samples are included in the study for ribosome footprinting and mRNA-Seq. These include wild-type and combination knockouts of Hcr1 and mutations of other eIF3 subunits and known ribosome recycling factors."
PRJNA510796,Translational Regulation of Metabolic Dynamics during Effector-Triggered Immunity,"It is not fully known whether translational regulation also occurs in later stage immune responses, such as effector-triggered immunity (ETI), which often leads to strong metabolic dynamics. In this study, we performed a genome-wide ribosome profiling in Arabidopsis upon ETI activation and discovered that specific groups of genes were translationally regulated, especially metabolic genes in aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, camalexin, and sphingolipid metabolism. The involvement of these components in the induction of ETI was confirmed by genetic analysis, amino acid profiling and exogeneous application of phenylalanine or an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Our findings provide new insight into the diverse translational regulation in the plant immune responses and demonstrate that translational coordination of metabolic gene expression is an important strategy for ETI activation. Overall design: Arabidopsis transgenic lines carrying the 35S:uORFsTBF1-LUC construct in WT Col-0 (C) background or rps2 (R) background were grown on soil at 22 °C under a 12/12-h light/dark cycle with 55% humidity. Leaf tissue (0.3 g) of 4 week old transgenic plants was collected 8 hours post inoculation with either Psm ES4326/AvrRpt2 (OD600nm = 0.01) (A) or 10 mM MgCl2 as Mock (M). For WT plants, 3 replicates of Mock and AvrRpt2 were collected for RNA-seq (RS) and Ribo-seq (RF). For rps2, 2 replicates were collected for Mock and AvrRpt2 RS and RF."

Liver samples were collected from mice of six (1, 3, 11, 20, 26 and 32 months) different ages, whereas kidney samples were collected from the same mice of three (3, 20 and 32 months) ages. Samples from three animals were taken for each age, except for 32 months old mice (2 animals)."
PRJNA510323,Translational profiling of dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord in a mouse model of neuropathic pain,"Acute pain serves as a protective mechanism, guiding the organism away from actual or potential tissue injury. In contrast, chronic pain is a debilitating condition without any obvious physiological function. The transition to, and the maintenance of chronic pain require new gene expression to support biochemical and structural changes within the pain pathway. The regulation of gene expression at the level of mRNA translation has emerged as an important step in the control of protein expression in the cell. Recent studies show that signaling pathways upstream of mRNA translation, such as mTORC1 and ERK, are upregulated in chronic pain conditions, and their inhibition effectively alleviates pain in several animal models. Despite this progress, mRNAs whose translation is altered in chronic pain conditions remain largely unknown. Here, we performed genome-wide translational profiling of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord dorsal horn tissues in a mouse model of neuropathic pain, spared nerve injury (SNI), using the ribosome profiling technique. We identified distinct subsets of mRNAs that are differentially translated in response to nerve injury in both tissues. We discovered key converging upstream regulators and pathways linked to mRNA translational control and neuropathic pain. Our data are crucial for the understanding of mechanisms by which mRNA translation promotes persistent hypersensitivity after nerve injury. Overall design: Four conditions were analysed, with each condition having duplicate samples. That is, eight tissue samples were collected. The eight samples were lysed and the lysate was divided into two parts, one was used to prepare a ribosome footprint library and the other fraction was used to prepare whole mRNA library. Thus, we had 16 libraries in total for sequencing. The four conditions studied were: spinal_cord_SNI with spinal_cord_SHam as control and DRG_SNI with SRG_sham as control."
PRJNA509509,Identifying small proteins by ribosome profiling with stalled initiation complexes,"Small proteins consisting of 50 or fewer amino acids have been identified as regulators of larger proteins in bacteria and eukaryotes. Despite the importance of these molecules, the true prevalence of these regulators remains unknown because conventional annotation pipelines usually exclude such small open reading frames (smORFs). We previously identified several dozen small proteins in the model organism Escherichia coli using theoretical bioinformatic approaches based on sequence conservation and matches to canonical ribosome binding sites. Here, we present an empirical approach for discovering new proteins, taking advantage of recent advances in ribosome profiling in which antibiotics are used to trap newly-initiated 70S ribosomes at start codons. This approach led to the identification of many novel initiation sites in intergenic regions in E. coli. We selected 41 smORFs for chromosomal tagging and detected small protein synthesis for all but 3. The corresponding genes are not only intergenic, but are also found antisense to other genes, in operons, and overlapping other open reading frames (ORFs), some impacting translation of larger downstream genes. These results demonstrate the utility of this method for identifying new genes, regardless of their genomic context. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of E. coli MG1655 cultures treated with Onc112, an antibiotic that traps ribosomes at start codons, as a means to identify start sites in intergenic regions."
PRJNA509424,Bias-minimized quantification of microRNA reveals widespread alternative processing and 3′ end modification,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate diverse biological and pathological processes via post-transcriptional gene silencing. High-throughput small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) has been widely adopted to investigate the functions and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs. However, accurate quantification of miRNAs has been limited owing to the severe ligation bias in conventional sRNA-seq methods. Here we quantify miRNAs and their variants (known as isomiRs) by an improved sRNA-seq protocol, termed AQ-seq (accurate quantification by sequencing), that utilizes adapters with terminal degenerate sequences and a high concentration of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which minimize the ligation bias during library preparation. Measurement using AQ-seq allows us to correct the previously misannotated 5' end usage and strand preference in public databases. Importantly, the analysis of 5' terminal heterogeneity reveals widespread alternative processing events which have been underestimated. We also identify highly uridylated miRNAs originating from the 3p strands, indicating regulations mediated by terminal uridylyl transferases at the pre-miRNA stage. Taken together, our study reveals the complexity of the miRNA isoform landscape, allowing us to refine miRNA annotation and to advance our understanding of miRNA regulation. Furthermore, AQ-seq can be adopted to improve other ligation-based sequencing methods including crosslinking-immunoprecipitation-sequencing (CLIP-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq). Overall design: Total RNA was isolated from HEK293T and HeLa cells, mixed with thirty synthetic miRNA-like spike-in oligos, and subjected to small RNA-seq library preparation using TruSeq (Illumina) or the AQ-seq method."
PRJNA509375,Codon usage optimization in pluripotent embryonic stem cells [tRNA sequencing],"The uneven use of synonymous codons in the transcriptome regulates the efficiency and fidelity of protein translation rates. Yet, the importance of this codon bias on regulating cell state-specific expression programs is currently debated. Here, we asked whether the gene expression program in the well-defined cell states of self-renewal and differentiation in embryonic stem cells is driven by optimized codon usage. Using ribosome and transcriptome profiling, we identified distinct codon signatures for human self-renewing and differentiating embryonic stem cells. One driver for the cell state-specific codon bias was the genomic GC-content of the differentially expressed genes and thus, determined by transcription rather than translation. However, by measuring the codon frequencies at the ribosome's active sites interacting with transfer RNAs (tRNA), we discovered that the wobble position tRNA modification inosine strongly influenced the codon optimization in self-renewing embryonic stem cells. This effect was conserved in mice and independent of the differentiation stimulus. In summary, we newly reveal how translational mechanisms based on RNA modifications can shape optimized codon usage in embryonic stem cells.  Overall design: tRNA sequencing of self-renewing and differentiating human H9 cells, 4 biological replicates per condition"
PRJNA509230,Mammalian Hbs1L deficiency causes Pelota depletion and is associated with a unique phenotype,"Hbs1 has been established as a central component of the cell's translational quality control pathways in both yeast and prokaryotic models; however, the functional characteristics of its human ortholog (Hbs1L) have not been well-defined.  We recently reported a novel human phenotype resulting from a mutation in the critical coding region of the HBS1L gene characterized by facial dysmorphism, severe growth restriction, axial hypotonia, global developmental delay and retinal pigmentary deposits.  Here we further characterize downstream effects of the human HBS1L mutation. HBS1L has three transcripts in humans, and RT-PCR demonstrated reduced mRNA levels corresponding with transcripts V1 and V2 whereas V3 expression was unchanged. Western blot analyses revealed HBS1L protein was absent in proband samples. Additionally, polysome profiling revealed an abnormal aggregation of 80S monosomes in patient cells under baseline conditions.  RNASeq data corresponded to the patient phenotype, with biological process analysis showing skeletal system development and sensory development genes being most altered between patient and controls.  Ribosomal sequencing demonstrated an increased translation efficiency of ribosomal RNA in Hbs1L-deficient fibroblasts, suggesting that there may be a compensatory increase in ribosome translation to accommodate the increased 80S monosome peak. Furthermore, lack of Hbs1L caused depletion of Pelota protein in both patient cells and mouse tissues, while PELO mRNA levels were unaffected. Inhibition of proteasomal function partially restored Pelota expression in human Hbs1L-deficient cells. We also describe a mouse model harboring a knockdown mutation in the murine Hbs1l gene that shared several of the phenotypic elements observed in the Hbs1L-deficient human including facial dysmorphism, growth restriction and retinal deposits. The Hbs1lKO mice similarly demonstrate diminished Pelota levels that were rescued by proteasome inhibition. Overall design: 12 physical samples of cell cultures (patient and 2 healthy individuals as controls, 2-6 replicates per individual). Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq libraries prepared from the same samples (matched within sample)"
PRJNA509149,Ribosomal protein RPL26 is the principal target of UFMylation,"UFM1 is a small, metazoan-specific, ubiquitin-like protein modifier that is essential for embryonic development. Although loss-of-function mutations in UFM1 conjugation are linked to ER stress, neither the biological function nor the relevant cellular targets of this protein modifier are known. Here we show that a largely uncharacterized ribosomal protein, RPL26, is the principal target of UFM1 conjugation. RPL26 UFMylation and deUFMylation is catalyzed by enzyme complexes tethered to the cytoplasmic surface of the ER and UFMylated RPL26 is highly enriched on ER membrane-bound ribosomes and polysomes. Biochemical analysis and structural modeling establish that UFMylated RPL26 and the UFMylation machinery are in close proximity to the SEC61 translocon, suggesting that this modification plays a direct role in cotranslational protein translocation into the ER. These data suggest that UFMylation is a ribosomal modification specialized to facilitate metazoan-specific protein biogenesis at the ER. Overall design: ribosome profiling of membrane and cytosolic fractions of UFM1-KO, UFSP2-KO, and wild-type HEK cells in duplicate (12 samples); mRNA-seq of whole cell lysates of UFM1-KO, UFSP2-KO, and wild-type HEK cells in duplicate (6 samples)"

PRJNA507750,Selective ribosome profiling to study interactions of translating ribosomes in yeast,"A number of enzymes, targeting factors and chaperones engage ribosomes to support fundamental steps of nascent protein maturation, including enzymatic processing, membrane targeting and co-translational folding. The selective ribosome profiling (SeRP) method is a new tool for studying the co-translational activity of maturation factors that provides proteome-wide information on a factor's nascent interactome, the onset and duration of binding and the mechanisms controlling factor engagement. SeRP is based on the combination of two ribosome-profiling (RP) experiments, sequencing the ribosome-protected mRNA fragments from all ribosomes (total translatome) and the ribosome subpopulation engaged by the factor of interest (factor-bound translatome). We provide a detailed SeRP protocol, exemplified for the yeast Hsp70 chaperone Ssb (stress 70 B), for studying factor interactions with nascent proteins that is readily adaptable to identifying nascent interactomes of other co-translationally acting eukaryotic factors. The protocol provides general guidance for experimental design and optimization, as well as detailed instructions for cell growth and harvest, the isolation of (factor-engaged) monosomes, the generation of a cDNA library and data analysis. Experience in biochemistry and RNA handling, as well as basic programing knowledge, is necessary to perform SeRP. Execution of a SeRP experiment takes 8–10 working days, and initial data analysis can be completed within 1–2 d. This protocol is an extension of the originally developed protocol describing SeRP in bacteria. Overall design: Method description. Control mixing experiment to show that no post-lysis binding occurs."
PRJNA507085,Multifaceted stoichiometry control of bacterial operons revealed by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry,"More than half of the protein-coding genes in bacteria are organized in polycistronic operons composed of two or more genes. Whether the operon organization maintains the stoichiometric expression of the genes within an operon remain under debate. In this study, we performed a label-free data-independent acquisition hyper reaction monitoring mass-spectrometry (HRM-MS) experiment to quantify the Escherichia coli proteome in exponential phase and quantified 93.6% of the cytosolic proteins, covering 67.9% and 56.0% of the translating polycistronic operons in BW25113 and MG1655 strains, respectively. We found the shorter operons tend to be more tightly controlled for stoichiometry than longer operons, and those operons for metabolic pathways are less controlled for stoichiometry compared with operons for protein complexes, illustrating the multifaceted nature of the operon-wise regulation: the operon-wise unified transcriptional level and gene-specific translational level. This multi-level regulation benefits the host by optimizing the efficiency of the productivity of metabolic pathways and maintenance of different types of protein complexes. Overall design: RNA-seq and Ribo-seq of E. coli strain BW25113 in M9 minimal medium"
PRJNA506725,The RNA-binding ubiquitin ligase MKRN1 functions in ribosome-associated quality control of poly(A)-translation,"Human cells have evolved quality control mechanisms to ensure protein homeostasis by detecting and degrading aberrant mRNAs and protein products. A common source of aberrant mRNAs is premature polyadenylation, which can result in non-functional protein products. Translating ribosomes that encounter poly(A) sequences are terminally stalled, followed by ribosome recycling and rapid decay of the truncated nascent polypeptide via the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). Here, we demonstrate that the conserved RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) promotes ribosome stalling at continuous A-tracts during RQC. Using individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP), we show that MKRN1 is positioned upstream of A-rich stretches and poly(A) tails in mRNAs through an interaction with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). Ubiquitin remnant profiling uncovered PABP and ribosomal protein RPS10 as well as additional translational regulators as main substrates of MRKN1. We propose that MKRN1 serves as a first line of poly(A) recognition at the mRNA level to prevent production of erroneous proteins, thus maintaining proteome integrity. Overall design: iCLIP experiments for GFP-MKRN1 with crosslinking at 254 nm and with 4SU and crosslinking at 365 nm"

PRJNA505780,Double Stranded DNA Breaks and Genome Editing Trigger Ribosome Remodeling and Translational Shutdown,"DNA damage activates a robust transcriptional stress response, but much less is known about how DNA damage impacts translation. The advent of genome editing with Cas9 has intensified interest in understanding cellular responses to DNA damage. Here, we find that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), including those induced by Cas9, trigger the loss of ribosomal protein RPS27A from ribosomes via p53-independent proteasomal degradation. Comparisons of Cas9 and dCas9 ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq experiments reveal a global translational response to DSBs that precedes changes in transcript abundance. Our results demonstrate that even a single DSB can lead to altered translational output and ribosome remodeling, suggesting caution in interpreting cellular phenotypes measured immediately after genome editing. Overall design: mRNA-Seq and ribosome profiling on HEK293 cells after inducing double-strand breaks by Cas9 RNP nucleofection, 36 hours and 72 hours after"

PRJNA504034,Annotation improvement and retroviral element discovery in the Chinese hamster genome using proteogenomics,"Here we generated a draft annotation for the newly assembled Chinese hamster genome and used RNA-Seq, proteomics, and Ribo-Seq to experimentally annotate the genome. We identified 4,333 new proteins compared to the hamster RefSeq protein annotation and 2,503 novel translational events (e.g., alternative splices, mutations, novel splices). Finally, we used this pipeline to identify the source of translated retroviruses contaminating recombinant products from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, including 131 type-C retroviruses, thus enabling future efforts to eliminate retroviruses by reducing the costs incurred with retroviral particle clearance. In summary, the improved annotation provides a more accurate platform for guiding CHO cell line engineering, including facilitating the interpretation of omics data, defining of cellular pathways, and engineering of complex phenotypes."

PRJNA503765,Retapamulin-assisted Ribo-seq reveals the alternative bacterial proteome,"Unorthodox rules of extracting genetic information enable proteome expansion without increasing the genome size. The use of alternative translation initiation sites achieves this goal by allowing production of more than one protein from a single gene. Although several such examples have been serendipitously found in bacteria, genome-wide experimental mapping of alternative translation start sites has been unattainable. We found that the antibiotic retapamulin specifically arrests initiating ribosomes at start codons of the genes. Retapamulin treatment followed by Ribo-seq analysis (Ribo-RET) not only allowed mapping of conventional initiation sites at the beginning of the annotated Escherichia coli genes but, strikingly, it also revealed putative alternative internal start sites in a number of genes. Experimental evidence demonstrated that the internal start codons can be recognized by the ribosomes and direct translation initiation in vitro and in vivo. Proteins, whose translation is initiated at an internal in-frame and out-of-frame start sites, can be functionally important and contribute to the 'alternative' bacterial proteome. In addition to proteome expansion, the internal start sites may play regulatory role in gene expression. Overall design: 4 samples of Ribo-seq data were analyzed. In this study we compared the distribution of ribosome density in BWK or BL21 strains of Escherichia coli, with or without Retapamulin treatment."
PRJNA503400,Cap-specific terminal N6-methylation of RNA by an RNA polymerase II-associated methyltransferase.,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a major modification of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), plays critical roles in RNA metabolism and function. In addition to the internal m6A, N6, 2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) is present at the transcription start nucleotide of capped mRNAs in vertebrates. However, its biogenesis and functional role remain elusive. Using a reverse genetics approach, we identified PCIF1, a factor that interacts with the serine-5-phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, as a cap-specific adenosine methyltransferase (CAPAM) responsible for N6-methylation of m6Am. The crystal structure of CAPAM in complex with substrates revealed the molecular basis of cap-specific m6A formation. A transcriptome-wide analysis revealed that N6-methylation of m6Am promotes the translation of capped mRNAs. Thus, a cap-specific m6A writer promotes translation of mRNAs starting from m6Am. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq"
PRJNA503322,High-throughput profiling of TnaC sensory peptide,"Translation is a fundamental biological process that makes proteins with mRNA as template. During the elongation process of translation, the nascent peptide moves through the exit tunnel within the bacterial ribosome 50S subunit. Growing body of evidences suggest that this tunnel is not only a simple passive pathway for the nascent peptide. In contrast, the interaction between the nascent peptide and the ribosome enables the regulation of many important biological processes, such as protein translation dynamics, downstream gene expression, protein folding, protein location in the cell, etc. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of this category of regulation, especially the kinetics issue during the process, remains elusive, largely due to the difficult to develop in vivo approach to monitor such process in real time.As a classical model of nascent peptide stalling, TnaC controls the downstream gene expression via a tryptophan induced ribosome-arrest mechanism. Tryptophan induced ribosome stalling can prevent the premature transcription termination of the downstream tnaA gene, thus resulting in a tryptophan dependent expression of tnaA. In this project, we presented a deep mutational scanning approach to study the kinetics of this gene expression regulation process. Briefly, we constructed a tnaC library consisting of 1,450 mutants, covering all possible single nucleotide mutations of this genetic element (codon 2~24 of 24aa TnaC peptide). Via fusing a GFP reporter downstream this tnaC variant library, we profiled the responses of all these 1,450 tnaC variants at three tryptophan concentrations (0, 100 and 500 uM). FACS is subsequently used to sort cells carrying different tnaC variants into different bins according to the GFP reporter expression. For each bin, we recovered ~100,000 cells and used NGS to dissect the abundance of each tnaC variant. Via this strategy, we constructed a comprehensive tnaC genetic map, shedding light on the key components for TnaC nascent peptide to conduct such gene regulation function. This map provides rich resources to understand the dynamics of this gene expression regulation process.Together with previous biochemical as well as structural studies, we proposed a kinetic model for this molecular mechanism consisted of two dynamic steps: the synchronization of transcription and translation, and subsequent nascent-peptide-ribosome-interaction derived translation stalling. This model demonstrates an interesting kinetics process at molecular level that coordinating the processing of biological macromolecules (RNA polymerase and ribosome) by a gene composed of only 75 nucleotides and one inducer small molecule. We think such method should also catalyze studies focusing on other nascent peptide (uORF in mammalian genome) based dynamic gene regulation process, which is actually widely adopted by organisms from bacteria to mammals to cope with signaling tasks."
PRJNA503203,Translatome and transcriptome analysis of TMA20 (MCT-1) and TMA64 (eIF2D) knockout yeast strains,"We report ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq data of S.cerevisiae strains with TMA20, TMA64 single- and TMA20/TMA64 double-gene knockouts, grown in the rich YPD or minimal SD medium.

Overall design: Huh7 cells were treated with 1.5 µM PF-06446846, 1.5µM PF-06378503 or vehicle for 60 minutes, and subjected to ribosome profiling. This study included three biological replicates"
PRJNA501872,Active ribosome profiling in SETD2 or METTL14 knockdown HepG2 cells,"SETD2 is the specific methyltransferase of H3K36me3, while METTL14 is a critical subunit of the m6A methyltransferase complex. To evaluate the effect of SETD2 and METTL14 on translation, we conducted robosome profiling in SETD2 and METTL14 knockdown and control HepG2 cells. Our RNA ribosome profiling revealed that depletion of SETD2 and METTL14 resulted in a global reduction in RNA translation and the changes of translation efficiency were correlated between SETD2 and METTL14 knockdown cells. Overall design: We performed active ribosome profiling in HepG2 cells with stably expressed SETD2, METTL14 or control shRNA."

This transgenic line uses the endothelial cell-specific kdrl promoter to drive expression of an epitope tagged Rpl10a 60S ribosomal subunit protein, allowing for Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) of actively translating endothelial cell mRNAs.  We also collected the whole embryo translatome using the TRAP protocol and a ubiquitously expressed tagged Rpl10a, and the endothelial transcritome by collecting the GFP+ endothelial cells that had the kdrl promoter driving GFP. Overall design: Examination of 24hpf zebrafish whole embryo translatome, 24hpf zebrafish endothelial translatome, and 24hpf zebrafish endothelial transciptome"
PRJNA499096,Fine-tuning metabolic rewiring and translational machinery adaptation during an epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells.,"During breast cancer progression, the epithelial to mesenchymal transition has been associated with metastasis and endocrine therapy resistance; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To gain insight into this process, we studied the transition undergone by MCF7-derived cells, which is driven by the constitutive nuclear expression of a MKL1 variant devoid of the actin binding domain (MKL1 ?N200). To identify major adaptive changes in gene expression during the luminal to basal-like transition, we carried out differential expression studies at both transcription and translation levels by RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling."
PRJNA499089,"RNA m6A-Ythdf1 in dendritic cells triggers anti-tumor immunity (MeRIP-Seq, RIP-Seq and Ribo-Seq in Flt3L-DCs)","Emerging evidence emphasizes the important role of tumor neoantigen in generating the spontaneous antitumor immune response and predicting the clinical response to immunotherapies. Despite the presence of numerous neoantigens, complete tumor elimination rarely occurs in majority of patients due to failures in mounting a sufficient and lasting antitumor immunity. Here we show that the durable neoanitgen-specific immunity is regulated by a m6A-binding protein, Ythdf1. In contrast to wild-type mice, Ythdf1-deficient (Ythdf1-/-) mice generate more antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response for persistent tumor control. Loss of Ythdf1 in dendritic cell (DC) results in an enhanced cross-presentation of tumor antigen and cross-priming of CD8+ T cell in vivo. To confirm our observations, we performed Ribo-Seq to analyze the translational efficiency of genes in DCs and performed m6A-seq to locate the m6A sites. Overall design: Flt3L-DCs obtained from WT and YTHDF1 KO mice were used to generate MeRIP-Seq, RIP-Seq and Ribo-Seq libraries. Two replicates for each conditions."
PRJNA498969,Identification of molecular markers for candidate sleep-promoting neurons in CeA using TRAP-seq,"A crucial step in understanding the sleep-control mechanism is to identify sleep neurons. In principle, a neuron could promote sleep by inhibiting wake-promoting neurons. Using rabies virus (RV)-mediated transsynaptic tracing, we identified several brain regions with GABAergic neurons that broadly inhibit multiple wake-promoting neuronal populations, and the most prominent source of GABAergic inputs was found in a posterior part of the CeA. The CeA is known to contain multiple subtypes of GABAergic neurons with distinct molecular markers, projection targets, and functional properties. Using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) RNA-Seq, we identified molecular markers for the canditate sleep-promoting neurons in CeA. Overall design: TRAP RNA-Seq profiling identifies transcripts enriched in CeA GABAergic neurons that project to wake-promoting brain regions (LC/PB)."

PRJNA497255,Genome-wide analysis of eIF4G-RNA interaction in CDK12-depleted cells (Ribo-Seq),"Methods: U2OS mRNA profiles of control siRNA(siControl) and siCDK12 were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level.

We generated genome-wide views of translation rate in CDK12-depleted U2OS cells in comparion to mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin treatment. We find that significant overlap and high corelation of change in eIF4G-associated mRNAs between two condition, rapamycin treatment and siCDK12 transfected cells.

PRJNA496049,Transcriptional profiling of mouse proximal tubular epithelial cells during injury and repair,"Proximal tubule has a remarkable capacity for repair after acute kidney injury. Whether dedifferentiation or a fixed progenitor population is responsible for this repair remains the subject of ongoing controversy. We have generated a novel genetic mouse model to address this question. We generated a Kim-1-GFPCreERt2 knockin mouse line (Kim1GCE) by homologous recombination. Kim-1 is expressed exclusively in dedifferentiated proximal tubule cells. We crossed this mouse line to the EGFP-L10a mouse line to perform Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification coupled with next generation sequencing (TRAP-seq) to identify the transcriptional signature of tubular epithelial cells during the course of injury and repair. TRAP-seq was performed in kidney samples at day 2, 7, and 14 after bilateral ischemia reperfusion injury and sham. Overall design: Bigenic Kim1-GCE; EGFPL10a heterozygous male mice (8-10 weeks old) received taxomifen 6 hours before and 24 hours after bilateral ischemia reperfusion injury.

PRJNA493293,In vivo RNAi mediated knockdown of translation initiation factor eIF3m is associated with alterations in ribosome biogenesis [RNAseq/Riboseq],"Translation is a fundamental biological process, which defines every aspect of cell physiology. Dysregulation of protein synthesis is associated with the diseases, such as ribosomopathies, diabetes, and cancer. To examine translation dysregulation in vivo, we employed RNA interference to knockdown m-subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF3 exclusively in mouse liver. We observed an increase in the number of monosomes and multiple signs of impaired translation. We further characterized the early cellular response using transcriptome sequencing, ribosome profiling, whole proteome, and phosphoproteome analyses. The major response of hepatocytes to eIF3m deficiency was associated with the changes in mRNA expression, with almost no effect on translation efficiency for particular mRNAs. The transcription changes fell into two main categories: ribosome biogenesis (increased transcription of ribosomal proteins, dephosphorylation of eIF2a, and inhibition of rRNA processing) and cell metabolism (lipid, amino acid, nucleic acid, and drug metabolism). Overall, this work uncovers a new mode of regulation of protein synthesis mediated by the inhibition of translation initiation. It also highlights advantages of RNAi-based in vivo approach for studying regulatory network associated with essential factors involved in mammalian translation. Overall design: RNAseq/Riboseq experiment of Eif3m knockdown in mouse livers at day 9 (3 replicates) and day 13 (2 replicates). Please note that GSM3327719-GSM3327724 sample raw data (in GSE118394) have been re-analyzed in the currect study and therefore, duplicated sample records (GSM3402655-GSM3402660) have been created for the convenient retrieval of the complete raw data from SRA."

PRJNA491747,Targeting the eIF4A dependent translation of KRAS and other oncoproteins in pancreatic cancer,"New and effective therapeutics are urgently needed for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The eIF4A/DDX2 RNA helicase drives translation of mRNAs with highly structured 5'UTRs. The natural compound silvestrol and synthetic analogues are potent and selective inhibitors of eIF4A1/2 that show promising activity in models of hematological malignancies. Here, we show silvestrol analogues have nanomolar activity against PDAC cell lines and organoids in vitro. Moreover, we see single agent activity in the KRAS/p53 mouse PDAC model and also against PDAC xenografts and primary, patient derived PDAC tumors. These therapeutic effects occur at non-toxic dose levels. Transcriptome-wide ribosome profiling, analyses of protein and gene expression, and translation reporter studies reveal that eIF4A inhibitors block an oncogenic translation program in PDAC cells that includes G-quadruplex containing mRNAs such as KRAS, MYC, YAP1, MET, SMAD3, TGFß and others. Together, our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of eIF4A disrupts oncoprotein production and shows efficacy across several PDAC models. Overall design: We performed ribosome footprinting and RNA sequencing on six samples of PANC1 cells including three untreated samples (DMSO) and three samples that were collected 45 minutes after treatment with CR31B (25 nM). DMSO treated samples are indicated as CT and CR31B treated samples are indicate as S."
PRJNA491649,Dazl regulates germ cell survival through a network of polA-proximal mRNA interactions [GC1-spg cells (parental line) Ribosome Profiling and RNA-seq],"The RNA binding protein Dazl is essential for gametogenesis, but its direct in vivo functions, RNA targets, and the molecular basis for germ cell loss in DAZL null mice are unknown.  Here, we mapped transcriptome-wide Dazl-RNA interactions in vivo, revealing Dazl binding to thousands of mRNAs via polyA-proximal 3?UTR interactions.  In parallel, fluorescence activated cell sorting and RNA-Seq identified mRNAs sensitive to Dazl deletion in male germ cells.  Despite binding a broad set of mRNAs, integrative analyses indicate that Dazl post-transcriptionally controls only a subset of its mRNA targets, namely those corresponding to a network of genes critical for germ cell proliferation and survival.  Additionally, we provide evidence that polyA sequences have key roles in specifying Dazl-RNA interactions across the transcriptome.  Altogether, our results reveal a mechanism for Dazl-RNA binding, and illustrate that Dazl functions as a master regulator of a post-transcriptional mRNA program essential for germ cell survival. Overall design: Ribosome Profiling and RNA-seq libraries from monoclonal cell line with doxycyline inducible Dazl expression (GC-1-spg parental line)"

PRJNA489895,Ribosome profiling of selenoproteins in vivo reveals consequences of pathogenic Secisbp2 missense mutations,"Re-coding of UGA codons as selenocysteine (Sec) codons in selenoproteins depends on a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in the 3' UTR of mRNAs of eukaryotic selenoproteins. SECIS-binding protein 2 (SECISBP2) increases the efficiency of this process. Pathogenic mutations in SECISBP2 reduce selenoprotein expression and lead to phenotypes associated with the reduction of deiodinase activities and selenoprotein N expression in humans. Two functions have been ascribed to SECISBP2: binding of SECIS elements in selenoprotein mRNAs and facilitation of co-translational Sec insertion. To separately probe both functions, we established here two mouse models carrying two pathogenic missense mutations in Secisbp2 previously identified in patients. We found that the C696R substitution in the RNAbinding domain abrogates SECIS binding and does not support selenoprotein translation above the level of a complete Secisbp2 null mutation. The R543Q missense substitution located in the selenocysteine insertion domain resulted in residual activity and caused reduced selenoprotein translation, as demonstrated by ribosomal profiling to determine the impact on UGA re-coding in individual selenoproteins. We found, however, that the R543Q variant is thermally unstable in vitro and completely degraded in the mouse liver in vivo, while being partially functional in the brain. The moderate impairment of selenoprotein expression in neurons led to astrogliosis and transcriptional induction of genes associated with immune responses. We conclude that differential SECISBP2 protein stability in individual cell types may dictate clinical phenotypes to a much greater extent than molecular interactions involving a mutated amino acid in SECISBP2 . Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-sequencing of cortex samples from 2 Secisbp2 R543Q/fl; Camk-Cre pos mice and 2 control mice."
PRJNA489863,Small is big in Arabidopsis mitochondrial ribosome,"Mitochondria are responsible for energy production through aerobic respiration and represent  the powerhouse of eukaryotic cells. Their metabolism and gene expression processes  combine bacterial-like features and traits that evolved in eukaryotes. Among mitochondrial  gene expression processes, translation remains the most elusive. In plants, while numerous  pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are involved in all steps of gene expression, their  function in translation remains unclear. Here we present the biochemical characterisation of  Arabidopsis mitochondrial ribosomes and identify their protein subunit composition.  Complementary biochemical approaches identify 19 plant specific mitoribosome proteins,  among which 10 are PPR proteins. The knock out mutations of ribosomal PPR (rPPR) genes  result in distinct macroscopic phenotypes including lethality or severe growth delays. The  molecular analysis of rppr1 mutants using ribosome profiling as well as the analysis of  mitochondrial protein levels reveal that rPPR1 is a generic translation factor, which is a novel  function for PPR proteins. Finally, single particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals the unique  structural architecture of Arabidopsis mitoribosomes, characterised by a very large small  ribosomal subunit, larger than the large subunit, bearing an additional RNA domain grafted  onto the head. Overall, our results show that Arabidopsis mitoribosomes are substantially  divergent from bacterial and other eukaryote mitoribosomes, both in terms of structure and of  protein content. Overall design: mitochondrial ribosome footprints from flowers of wildtype or PPR336 (At1g61870) mutant."
PRJNA489713,Translation of upstream open reading frames in a model of neuronal differentiation,"Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) initiate translation within mRNA 5' leaders,and have the potential to altermain coding sequence(CDS) translationontranscripts in which they reside. Ribosome profiling(RP)studies suggest that translating ribosomes are pervasive within 5' leadersacross model systems. However, the significance of this observationremains unclear. To explore a role for uORF usage in neuronal differentiation, we performed RP on undifferentiated and differentiated human neuroblastoma cells. Using a spectral coherence algorithm (SPECtre),we identify4,954uORFsacross31%of all neuroblastoma transcripts. These uORFspredominantly utilize non-AUG initiationcodonsand exhibit translational efficiencies(TE)comparable to annotated coding regions. Usage of both AUG initiated uORFs and aconservedandconsistently translated subset of non-AUG initiated uORFs correlateswith repressed CDS translation. Ribosomal protein transcripts are enriched in uORFs, and select uORFs on such transcripts were validated for expression. Withneuronal differentiation, we observedan overall positive correlation between translational shifts in uORF/CDSpairs. However,a subset of transcripts exhibit inverse shifts in translation of uORF/CDSpairs. TheseuORFsare enriched in AUG initiation sites, non-overlapping, and shorterin length. Cumulatively, CDSs downstream of uORFs characterized by persistent translation show smaller shifts in TE withneuronal differentiation relative to CDSs without a predicted uORF, suggesting that fluctuations in CDS translation are buffered by uORF translation. In sum, this work provides insights into the dynamic relationshipsand potential regulatory functionsof uORF/CDS pairs in a model of neuronal differentiation.

PRJNA489275,Assembly and functionality of the ribosome with tethered subunits,"Ribo-T is an engineered ribosome whose small and large subunits are tethered together by insertion of circularly permutated 23S rRNA into 16S rRNA [Orelle, C., Carlson, E. D., Szal, T., Florin, T., Jewett, M. C., Mankin, A.S. Protein synthesis by ribosomes with tethered subunits. Nature 524, 119-124 (2015)]. Whether the growth defects are related to problems with Ribo-T functionality is unclear. The translation in Ribo-T cells was examined by ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Besides the control cells carrying dissociable WT ribosome (SQ171),  RIBO-T cells are the original SQ171 strain transformed with pRibo-T plasmid and cured of the plasmid carrying wt rRNA that was evolved to have improved growth characteristics. The Ribo-T strain carries two mutations: a nonsense mutation in the Leu22 codon of the ybeX gene and a missense mutation in codon 549 of the rpsA gene encoding ribosomal protein S1. Analysis of Ribo-T performance by ribosome profiling showed a notably higher ribosome occupancy of the start codons and somewhat increased occupancy at the stop codons of many genes, suggesting that subunit tethering specifically impairs the initiation and termination stages of translation. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq was performed on Escherichia coli Ribo-T (a derivative of the strain SQ171, 2 biological replicates) and compared to a SQ171 control cells carrying WT ribosomes (2 biological replicates)."
PRJNA488955,Iron and Heme Coordinate Erythropoiesis through HRI-Mediated Regulation of Protein Translation and Gene Expression,"Iron and heme play central roles in red blood cell production. However, the mechanisms by which iron and heme levels coordinate erythropoiesis remain incompletely understood. HRI is a heme-regulated kinase that controls translation by phosphorylating eIF2a. Here, we investigate the global impact of iron, heme and HRI on protein translation in vivo in murine primary erythroblasts using ribosome profiling. By defining the underlying changes in translation during iron and HRI deficiencies, we validate known regulators of this process, including Atf4, and identify novel pathways such as co-regulation of ribosomal protein mRNA translation. Surprisingly, we found that heme and HRI pathways, but not iron-regulated pathways, mediate the major protein translational and transcriptional responses to iron deficiency in erythroblasts in vivo and thereby identify previously unappreciated regulators of erythropoiesis. Our genome-wide study uncovers the major impact of the HRI-mediated integrated stress response for the adaptation to iron deficiency anemia. Overall design: Primary basophilic erythroblasts from E14.5 fetal livers (FLs) of Wild-type (Wt) and Hri-/- mice maintained under +Fe or -Fe conditions were sorted. FLs from embryos of the same mother were pooled before sorting. Two and three biological replicas of each condition were collected for preparations of Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq libraries, respectively."
PRJNA488293,N6-methyladenosine (m6A) profiling of ovarian cancer tissues,"We developed RADAR , a method for detecting differential methylated loci in MeRIP-seq data. RADAR uses a flexible model to accommodate increased noise due to RNA immunoprecipitation and are compatible with complex study design. RADAR enabled accurate identification of altered methylation sites in patient  samples where covariates need to be accounted for. We use the m6A-profiling of ovarian cancer data as an example data set to benchmart the performance of RADAR and a few alternative methods. Overall design: Six omental tumor tissues were collected from newly diagnosed patients with advanced, metastatic high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Seven normal fallopian tube tissues were collected from patients with benign gynecological conditions. Total RNA was extracted from the tissue by TRIzol followed by fragmentation with Bioruptor ultrasonicator. m6A-immunoprecipitation were performed using EpiMark N6-Methyladenosine enrichment kit (NEB cat. E1610S). Takara Pico-Input Strand-Specific Total RNA-seq for Illumina was used to construct library from total RNA where ribosome-derived cDNA was removed before final library amplification. The libraries were sequenced by the NextSeq 500 platform at PE37 mode."
PRJNA488109,A systematically-revised ribosome profiling protocol for bacteria reveals translational pauses at single-codon resolution,"In eukaryotes, ribosome profiling provides insight into the mechanism of protein synthesis at the codon level. In bacteria, however, the method has been more problematic and no consensus has emerged for how to best prepare profiling samples. Here, we identify the sources of these problems and describe new solutions for arresting translation and harvesting cells in order to overcome them. These improvements remove confounding artifacts and improve the resolution to allow analyses of ribosome behavior at the codon level. With a clearer view of the translational landscape in vivo, we observe that filtering cultures leads to translational pauses at serine and glycine codons through the reduction of tRNA aminoacylation levels. This observation illustrates how bacterial ribosome profiling studies can yield insight into the mechanism of protein synthesis at the codon level and how these mechanisms are regulated in response to changes in the physiology of the cell. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of E. coli MG1655 using a variety of lysis buffers and cell harvesting conditions"

PRJNA486442,Stoichiometric Production of Protein-Complex Components in Eukaryotes Without Widespread Feedback Regulation,"Constituents of multi-protein complexes are required at well-defined levels relative to each other. However, it remains unknown whether eukaryotic cells typically produce precise amounts of subunits, or instead rely on degradation to mitigate imprecise production. Here we quantified the production rates of multi-protein complexes in single- and multi-cellular eukaryotes using ribosome profiling. By resolving read-mapping ambiguities present in a large fraction of ribosome footprints which often distorts quantitation accuracy in eukaryotes, we found that obligate components of multi-protein complexes are produced in proportion to their stoichiometry, indicating that their abundances are already precisely tuned at the synthesis level. By systematically interrogating the impact of gene dosage variations in budding yeast, we found a general lack of negative feedback regulation protecting the normally precise rates of subunit synthesis. These results reveal a core principle of proteome homeostasis and highlight the evolution towards quantitative control at every stage of the central dogma. Overall design: 13 ribosome profiling experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae"
PRJNA486365,PERK-dependent gene expression programs of the acute and chronic cellular response to ER stress,"The UPR (Unfolded Protein Response) is a well-orchestrated response to ER protein folding and processing overload, integrating both transcriptional and translational outputs. Its three arms in mammalian cells, the PERK translational response arm, together with the ATF6 and IRE1-mediated transcriptional arms, have been thoroughly investigated.    Using ribosome footprint profiling, we performed a deep characterization of the gene expression programs involved in the acute and adaptive ER stress responses. We utilized MEFs (Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts) treated with Thapsigargin for different durations, that were wither WT or PERK knockouts, to determine the role of PERK in the acute and chronic UPR. We characterized three major gene expression programs: acute induction, chronic induction, and repression, and found that they were all PERK dependent. All three programs were recapitulated in publicly available data and in NIH3T3 cells. While PERK -/- cells did not recapitulate these responses in the acute timepoints, late timepoints showed an extremely weak induction/repression, suggesting that the chronic responses in WT cells are largely PERK dependent as well. We found that most ER target proteins were significantly repressed; including transmembrane proteins, glycoproteins, and proteins with disulfide bonds. We further demonstrate the downregulation of cyclins, while the expression of the amino acid biosynthesis pathway was enhanced. Overall design: We utilized MEFs (Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts) treated with Thapsigargin for different durations (1h, 2h, 5h, 8h), that were wither WT or PERK knockouts, to determine the role of PERK in the acute and chronic UPR. Thapsigargin was applied also with NIH 3t3 cells within two differet time-points (2h 7h) as well."
PRJNA486172,Transcriptome and translatome of Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680,"The gram-positive bacterium, Streptomyces avermitilis holds industrial importance, which produces widely used anthelmintic agent, avermectin. Furthermore, S. avermitilis is generally considered as a prominent heterologous gene expression host for diverse secondary metabolites biosynthesis. However, despite of its industrial importance, it largely remains unknown how its genome is organized and regulated for timely gene expression. Here, we determined 1,601 transcription units (TU) encoded in its genome using the integrated analysis of high-throughput sequencing data including dRNA-Seq, Term-Seq, RNA-Seq, and Ribo-Seq. In addition to TU cataloguing, these information-rich results also revealed the presence of diverse regulatory elements for the transcriptional and translational control of individual TU, such as promoters, 5¢-UTRs, terminators, 3¢-UTRs, and riboswitches. The conserved promoter sequences for transcription initiation were identified from 2,361 transcription start sites as 5¢-TANNNT and 5¢-TGAC for -10 and -35 elements, respectively. Interestingly, the -35 element and spacer length between them were critical for transcriptional regulation of functionally distinct genes. Total 2,017 transcription termination sites were detected from Term-Seq analysis, revealing that stem structure formation is a prerequisite for transcription termination and that Rho-independent termination prevails in S. avermitilis. Lastly, the TU architecture suggests the presence of novel small RNAs and cis-regulatory elements in the genome. Our findings will serve as invaluable resources for comprehensive understanding on regulatory features of S. avermitilis. Moreover, it is anticipated the elevation of its potential as the heterologous expression host for diverse secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Overall design: Profiles of 5' termini of primary transcripts, 3' termini of whole transcripts, whole transcripts and ribosome protected RNA fragements of Streptomyces avermitilis were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hi-Seq 2500"
PRJNA485439,In vivo RNAi mediated knockdown of translation initiation factor eIF3m is associated with alterations in ribosome biogenesis (mRNA-seq),"Translation is a fundamental biological process, which defines every aspect of cell physiology. Dysregulation of protein synthesis is associated with the diseases, such as ribosomopathies, diabetes, and cancer. To examine translation dysregulation in vivo, we employed RNA interference to knockdown m-subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF3 exclusively in mouse liver. We observed an increase in the number of monosomes and multiple signs of impaired translation. We further characterized the early cellular response using transcriptome sequencing, ribosome profiling, whole proteome, and phosphoproteome analyses. The major response of hepatocytes to eIF3m deficiency was associated with the changes in mRNA expression, with almost no effect on translation efficiency for particular mRNAs. The transcription changes fell into two main categories: ribosome biogenesis (increased transcription of ribosomal proteins, dephosphorylation of eIF2a, and inhibition of rRNA processing) and cell metabolism (lipid, amino acid, nucleic acid, and drug metabolism). Overall, this work uncovers a new mode of regulation of protein synthesis mediated by the inhibition of translation initiation. It also highlights advantages of RNAi-based in vivo approach for studying regulatory network associated with essential factors involved in mammalian translation. Overall design: RNAseq experiment comparing 3 replicates of Eif3m knockdown mouse livers with 3 replicates of control mouse livers at day 9 and 3 replicates of Eif3m knockdown mouse livers with 3 replicates of control mouse livers at day 13."

PRJNA484941,Cancer associated mRNAs regulated by the Helix Loop Helix motif of human EIF3A,"Improper regulation of translation initiation, a vital check-point of protein synthesis in the cell, has been linked to a number of cancers. Overexpression of protein subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) has been associated with increased translation of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation. In addition to playing a major role in general translation initiation by serving as a scaffold for the assembly of translation initiation complexes, eIF3 regulates translation of specific cellular mRNAs and viral RNAs. Mutations in the N-terminal Helix-Loop-Helix (HLH) RNA-binding motif of the EIF3A subunit in eIF3 interfere with Hepatitis C Virus Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) mediated translation initiation in vitro. Here we use RNA-seq and ribosome profiling of engineered lentiviral HEK293T cells to show that the EIF3A HLH motif controls translation of a small set of cellular transcripts enriched in oncogenic mRNAs, including MYC. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analysis of control and EIF3A triple mutant HEK293T cells in biological triplicates."

PRJNA481680,mRNA circularization by METTL3-eIF3h enhances translation,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of mRNA catalyzed by METTL3 is enriched at a subset of stop codons. METTL3 can promote translation but the mechanism and widespread relevance remain unknown. Here we show that METTL3 enhances translation only when tethered to reporter mRNA at sites close to the stop codon supporting a mRNA looping mechanism for ribosome recycling and translational control. Electron microscopy revealed the topology of individual polyribosomes with single METTL3 foci found in close proximity to 5' cap-binding proteins. We identify a direct physical and functional interaction between METTL3 and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit h (eIF3h). METTL3 promotes translation of a large subset of oncogenic mRNAs, including BRD4 that are also m6A-modified in human primary lung tumors. The METTL3-eIF3h interaction is required for enhanced translation, formation of densely packed polyribosomes, and oncogenic transformation. METTL3 depletion inhibits tumorigenicity and sensitizes lung cancer cells to BRD4 inhibition. These findings uncover a mRNA looping mechanism of translation control and identify METTL3-eIF3h as a potential cancer therapeutic target. Overall design: METTL3 expression was depleted in HeLa cells using lentivirus mediated shRNA knockdown. The METTL3 knockdown cells and the control cells were subjected to sucrose gradient ultracentifuge for the polysome profiling. The RNA samples isolated from the polysome fractions and subpolysome fractions were used for high throughput sequencing for the analysis of translation efficiency. For the analysis of mRNA stability, METTL3 knockdown cells and the control cells were treated with ActD for different time points then the RNA samples were isolated for high throughput sequencing and the subsequent calculation of mRNA halflife."

PRJNA480907,Peptides encoded by 5’ untranslated regions mediate pain sensitization,"Nociceptors are neurons responsible for the detection of pain producing stimuli. Persistent changes in their activity, termed plasticity, benefit survival through injury avoidance and are regulated on a translational basis. Yet, the mRNAs whose translation facilitates plasticity are unknown. Here, we apply ribosome profiling to dorsal root ganglion and identify a small number of transcripts that are selectively translated in response to plasticity mediators. Among them are Arc and Fos, genes implicated in episodic learning in the brain. We demonstrate that the ribosomal S6 kinase 1 is responsible for their production in nociceptors. Blocking S6 driven translation also reduces pain associated behavioral responses in vivo. In addition to translation of coding regions of mRNA, we detect pervasive ribosome occupancy in 5' untranslated regions. We find that peptides encoded by open reading frames in the 5' untranslated regions of Calca and Egr2 increase neuronal excitability in vitro and are sufficient to induce pain-like behaviors in vivo. Together, our findings uncover new targets of translational control that drive changes in plasticity and suggest new mechanisms for targeted pain therapeutics that disrupt pain signaling.

PRJNA479682,Cotranslational assembly of protein complexes in eukaryotes revealed by ribosome profiling,"Folding of newly synthesized proteins to the native state is a major challenge within the crowded cellular environment, since non-productive interactions can lead to misfolding, aggregation and degradation1. Cells cope with this challenge by coupling synthesis with polypeptide folding and by employing molecular chaperones to safeguard folding already cotranslationally2. However, little is known about the final step of folding, the assembly of polypeptides into complexes, although most of the cellular proteome forms oligomeric assemblies3. In prokaryotes, a proof-of-concept study showed that assembly of heterodimeric luciferase is an organized cotranslational process, facilitated by spatially confined translation of the subunits encoded on a polycistronic mRNA4. In eukaryotes, however, fundamental differences such as rarity of polycistronic mRNAs and different chaperone constellations raise the question whether assembly is also coordinated with translation. Here we provide a systematic and mechanistic analysis of protein complex assembly in eukaryotes using ribosome profiling. We determined the in vivo nascent subunits interactions of 12 hetero-oligomeric protein complexes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at near-residue resolution. We find 9 complexes assemble cotranslationally; the 3 complexes that do not show cotranslational interactions are regulated by dedicated assembly chaperones5-7. Cotranslational assembly often occurs uni-directionally, with one fully synthesized subunit engaging its nascent partner subunit(s), thereby counteracting its aggregation propensity. The onset of cotranslational subunit association coincides sharply with full exposure of the nascent interaction domain at the ribosomal tunnel exit. The action of the ribosome-associated Hsp70 chaperone Ssb8 is coordinated with assembly. Ssb transiently engages partially synthesized interaction domains, then dissociates before the onset of partner subunit association, presumably to prevent premature assembly interactions. Our study shows that cotranslational subunit association is a prevalent mechanism for hetero-oligomers assembly in yeast and indicates that translation, folding and assembly of protein complexes are integrated processes in eukaryotes. Overall design: Investigating the interaction of 26 individual complex subunits with nascent polypeptide chains in yeast."
PRJNA478925,A Chemical Kinetic Basis for Measuring Translation Initiation and Elongation Rates from Ribosome Profiling data,"Analysis methods based on simulations and optimization have been previously developed to estimate relative translation rates from next-generation sequencing data. Translation involves molecules and chemical reactions; hence, bioinformatics methods consistent with the laws of chemistry and physics are more likely to produce accurate results. Here, we derive simple equations based on chemical kinetic principles to measure the translation-initiation rate, transcriptome-wide elongation rate, and individual codon translation rates from ribosome profiling experiments. Our methods reproduce the known rates from ribosome profiles generated from detailed simulations of translation. Applying our methods to data from S. cerevisiae and mouse embryonic stem cells we find that the extracted rates reproduce previously reported correlations with various molecular quantities. A codon can exhibit up to 26-fold variability in its translation rate depending upon its context with in a transcript. This broad distribution means that the average translation rate of a codon is not representative of the rate at which most instances of that codon are translated. We also find that mouse embryonic stem cells have a global translation speed that is almost two-fold faster than previously reported. This large variability in translation rates suggests that translational regulation might be used by cells to a greater degree than previously thought.

Each library contains a single dsRNA trigger targeting a single gene. In total five triggers were tested in three genes (unc-15, unc-22, and unc-54). We quantified RNA levels and ongoing translation by RNA-seq and Ribo-seq (ribosome footprinting), respectively.

PRJNA477831,Optimization of Ribosome Profiling Using Brain Tissue from Fragile X Mice,"Dysregulated protein synthesis is a major underlying cause of many neurodevelopmental diseases such as Fragile X Syndrome. A very robust technique is required to capture subtle but biologically significant differences in neurological disorders. Ribosome profiling, which is based on deep sequencing of mRNA fragments protected from ribonuclease digestion by ribosomes, is a powerful tool to study translational control. However, it has been mainly applied to rapidly dividing cells where translation is robust and where large amounts of starting material are readily available. The application of ribosome profiling to low-input brain tissue where translation is modest and where gene expression changes between genotypes are expected to be small has not been carefully evaluated. Using hippocampal tissue from wide type and fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) knockout mice, we show that variable RNase digestion can lead to significant sample batch effects. We also establish GC content and ribosome footprint length as quality control metrics for ribonuclease digestion. We performed ribonuclease titration experiments for low-input samples to identify optimal conditions for this critical step that is often improperly conducted. Our data reveal that optimal RNase digestion is essential to ensure high quality and reproducibility of ribosome profiling especially for low-input brain tissue.

PRJNA477799,Charting DENR-dependent translation reinitiation uncovers predictive uORF features and links to circadian timekeeping via Clock,"The non-canonical initiation factor DENR promotes translation reinitiation on uORF-containing mRNAs. Moreover, DENR depletion shortens circadian period in mouse fibroblasts, suggesting that uORF usage and reinitiation regulate clock function. To identify DENR-regulated translation events transcriptome-wide and, in particular, specific core clock transcripts affected by this mechanism, we have used ribosome profiling in DENR-deficient NIH3T3 cells. We found 240 transcripts with altered translation rate, and used linear regression analysis to extract uORF features predictive of DENR dependance. Among core clock genes, we identified Clock as a DENR target. Using Clock 5'UTR mutants, we mapped the specific uORF through which DENR acts to regulate CLOCK protein biosynthesis. Notably, these experiments identified an alternative downstream start codon, which likely represents the true CLOCK N-terminus. Our findings provide insights into uORF-mediated translational regulation that can regulate the mammalian circadian clock and gene expression at large. Overall design: Denr knock-down or control NIH3t3 cells were grown to subconfluency in 15 cm plates/replicate. Cells were pre-treated with cycloheximide for 2 min, prior to lysate preparation. Two different sh-RNAs were used for knock-down experiments, and  Ribosome profiling (RPF-seq) and parallel RNA-seq libraries were prepared in triplicate for each.

PRJNA476979,The androgen receptor regulates a druggable translational regulon in advanced prostate cancer [ribosome profiling],"The recent advent of highly potent inhibitors of the androgen receptor and androgen biosynthesis has had the unfortunate iatrogenic effect of fueling new lethal prostate cancer phenotypes in patients. In particular, non-neuroendocrine androgen receptor-low castration resistant prostate cancer (AR low CRPC) is increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The mechanisms that promote this phenotype remain poorly understood. Through molecular studies of murine and human models of AR low CRPC, we have identified a new functional interface between the androgen receptor and the translation initiation complex inhibitor 4EBP1. AR directly regulates 4EBP1 expression which translationally represses eIF4F complex formation and a pro-proliferation program. In the context of AR low prostate cancer, de-repression of translation initiation drives the aberrant expression of the pro-proliferation regulon which fuels uncontrolled cell growth. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of the downstream eIF4F translation initiation complex reverses the proliferation phenotype in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal a new previously unrecognized druggable nexus which functionally link the processes of mRNA transcription and translation initiation in a rapidly emerging class of advanced lethal prostate cancer Overall design: Androgen receptor low prostate cancer has been on the rise with the advent of potent androgen receptor and androgen biosynthesis inhibitors and is uniformly fatal. The mechanisms underlying disease progression remains unresolved. We have identified a previously unknown direct interaction between the androgen receptor and the translation initiation complex inhibitor 4EBP1 which plays a critical role in protein synthesis rates, mRNA specific translation, and disease progression in vivo. This is mediated through the hyperactivation of the downstream eIF4F translation initiation complex which usurps a network of pro-proliferation mRNAs. Importantly, using both genetic and pharmacologic methods, we demonstrate that dissociation of the eIF4F complex reverses the proliferation program leading to tumor regression. As such, we have identified a new therapeutic paradigm for targeting lethal androgen receptor low prostate cancer.

PRJNA475896,Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes,"Regulation of gene expression acts at numerous complementary levels to control and refine the protein abundance. The analysis of mRNAs associated to polysomes, called polysome profiling, has been used to investigate post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in different biological processes. Pluripotent stem cells, as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), are able to differentiate into a variety of cell lineages and the cell commitment progression is carefully orchestrated. Genome-wide expression profiling had provided the possibility to investigate transcriptional changes during cardiomyogenic differentiation, however, a more accurate study regarding post-transcription regulation is required. In the present work, we isolated and high-throughput sequenced ribosome-free and polysome-bound RNAs from undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells and the subsequent differentiation stages of cardiomyogenesis: embryoid body aggregation, mesoderm, cardiac progenitor and cardiomyocytes. Expression of developmental markers were followed by flow cytometry and quality analysis were performed as technical controls to ensure high quality data. Our dataset provides valuable information about hESC cardiac differentiation and can be used to investigate genes potentially controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms."
PRJNA475870,Single-cell RNA sequencing of the mammalian pineal gland identifies two pinealocyte subtypes and cell type-specific daily patterns of gene expression,"The vertebrate pineal gland is dedicated to the production of the hormone melatonin, which increases at night to influence circadian and seasonal rhythms.  This increase is associated with dramatic changes in the pineal transcriptome.  Here, single-cell analysis of the rat pineal transcriptome was approached by sequencing mRNA from ~17,000 individual pineal cells, with the goals of profiling the cells that comprise the pineal gland and examining the proposal that there are two distinct populations of pinealocytes differentiated by the expression of Asmt, which encodes the enzyme that converts N-acetylserotonin to melatonin.  In addition, this analysis provides evidence of cell-specific time-of-day dependent changes in gene expression.  Nine transcriptomically distinct cell types were identified: ~90% were classified as melatonin-producing a- and ß-pinealocytes (1:19 ratio).  Non-pinealocytes included three astrocyte subtypes, two microglia subtypes, vascular and leptomeningeal cells, and endothelial cells.  a-Pinealocytes were distinguished from ß-pinealocytes by ~3-fold higher levels of Asmt transcripts.  In addition, a-pinealocytes have transcriptomic differences that likely enhance melatonin formation by increasing the availability of the Asmt cofactor S-adenosylmethionine, resulting from increased production of a precursor of S-adenosylmethionine, ATP.  These transcriptomic differences include ~2-fold higher levels of the ATP-generating oxidative phosphorylation transcriptome and ~8-fold lower levels of the ribosome transcriptome, which is expected to reduce the consumption of ATP by protein synthesis.  These findings suggest that a-pinealocytes have a specialized role in the pineal gland:  efficiently O-methylating the N-acetylserotonin produced and released by ß-pinealocytes, thereby improving the overall efficiency of melatonin synthesis.  We have also identified transcriptomic changes that occur between night and day in seven cell types, the majority of which occur in ß-pinealocytes and to a lesser degree in a-pinealocytes; many of these changes were mimicked by adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol.

PRJNA475675,The LIN28B-IMP1 post-transcriptional regulon has opposing effects on oncogenic  signaling in the intestine,"Aim: RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are expressed broadly during both development and malignant transformation, yet their mechanistic roles in epithelial homeostasis or as drivers of tumor initiation and progression are incompletely understood. Method: Here we describe a novel interplay between RBPsLIN28B and IMP1 in intestinal epithelial cells. Ribosome-profiling and RNA-sequencing identifies IMP1 as a principle nodefor gene expression regulation downstream of LIN28B. Results: In vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that epithelial IMP1 loss increases expression of WNT target genes and enhances LIN28B-mediated intestinal tumorigenesis, which was reversed when we overexpressed IMP1 independently in vivo. Furthermore, IMP1 loss in wild type or LIN28B-overexpressing mice enhancesthe regenerative response to irradiation. Conclusions: Together, our data provide new evidence for the opposing effects of the LIN28B-IMP1 axis on post-transcriptional regulation of canonical WNT signaling, with implications in intestinal homeostasis, regeneration and tumorigenesis.

PRJNA475266,Molecular profiling of reticular gigantocellularis neurons,"we used technique that allows the molecular characterization of particular neuronal subpopulations based on their neuroanatomical projections and the locations of their cell bodies.  This 'retro-TRAP' (translating ribosome affinity purification from retrogradely labeled neurons) approach relies on viral injection into an anatomical area targeted by the neurons of interest, followed by selective precipitation of ribosomes from retrogradely labeled cell bodies, and subsequent RNAseq analysis. Overall design: By comparing the mRNAs enriched in the NGC neurons which are retrogradely labeled due to viral injection into central thalamus, to gene expression of non-labeled surrounding cells in NGC, and then performing a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of these results, we were able to identify genes enriched in these cells. This procedure allowed us to highlight genes and pathways unique to these neurons with projections ascending to thalamus, as compared to other cells in reticular NucleusGigantocellularis."
PRJNA475144,Cell type specific profiling of alternative translation identifies novel protein isoforms in the mouse brain,"Translation canonically begins at a single AUG and terminates at the stop codon, generating one protein species per transcript. However, some transcripts may use alternative initiation sites or sustain translation past their stop codon, generating multiple protein isoforms. Through other mechanisms such as alternative splicing, both neurons and glia exhibit remarkable transcriptional diversity, and these other forms of post-transcriptional regulation are impacted by neural activity and disease. Here, using ribosome footprinting, we demonstrate that alternative translation is likewise abundant in the central nervous system and modulated by stimulation and disease. First, in neuron/glia mixed cultures we identify hundreds of transcripts with alternative initiation sites and confirm the protein isoforms corresponding to a subset of these sites by mass spectrometry. Many of them modulate their alternative initiation in response to KCl stimulation, indicating activity-dependent regulation of this phenomenon. Next, we detect several transcripts undergoing stop codon readthrough thus generating novel C-terminally-extended protein isoforms in vitro. Further, by coupling Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification to ribosome footprinting to enable cell-type specific analysis in vivo, we find that several of both neuronal and astrocytic transcripts undergo readthrough in the mouse brain. Functional analyses of one of these transcripts, Aqp4, reveals readthrough confers perivascular localization, indicating readthrough can be a conserved mechanism to modulate protein function. Finally, we show that AQP4 readthrough is disrupted in multiple gliotic disease models. Our study demonstrates the extensive and regulated use of alternative translational events in the brain and indicates that some of these events alter key protein properties. [NOTE: this GEO series only contains in vivo data] Overall design: For in vivo experiments (4 samples in total): 2 replicates were prepared from P21 Snap25::eGFP-RpL10a mouse brains for profiling neurons, 2 replicates from Aldh1l1:: eGFP-RpL10a mouse brains for profiling astrocytes. All samples were uniquely indexed and pooled across two lanes.  For each sample, the uploaded fastq files are union of both lanes."
PRJNA474715,Global proteome remodeling during ER stress involves Hac1-driven expression of long undecoded transcript isoforms,"Cellular stress response pathways often require transcription-based activation of gene expression to promote cellular adaptation. However, whether general mechanisms exist for stress-responsive gene down-regulation is less clear. A recently defined gene regulatory mechanism enables both up- and down-regulation of protein levels for distinct gene sets by the same transcription factor (TF) via coordinated induction of canonical mRNAs and long undecoded transcript isoforms (LUTIs). We analyzed deep, parallel gene expression datasets to determine whether this mechanism contributes to the conserved Hac1-driven branch of the unfolded protein response (UPRER). Indeed, we found Hac1-dependent protein down-regulation that accompanied the well-characterized up-regulation of ER-related proteins that typifies UPRER activation. Proteins down-regulated by Hac1-driven LUTIs include those with electron transport chain (ETC) function.  Aerobic respiration also appears dampened during the UPRER, and abrogated ETC function improves the fitness of UPRER-activated cells, suggesting functional importance of LUTI regulation during the UPRER. We conclude that the UPRER involves large-scale proteome remodeling, mediated in part by Hac1-induced LUTIs, and that this mechanism enables coordination of up- and down-regulation of gene expression during this stress response. Overall design: Sequencing of mRNA molecules and ribosome footprints to identify regulated transcript isoform changes that result in apparent translational regulation. In short, two major experiments are included here, one for parallel mRNA-seq and ribosome profiling of cells with or without UPR induction by either DTT or Tm, with or without deletion of HAC1. The other experiment investigates the examines the same type of measurements for cells that are either WT or depleted for Hac1 and treated with DTT."

We found that initial recovery is independent of nutrient-responsive, trans-spliced genes, suggesting that animal density is the primary trigger for the resumption of development in this species.

PRJNA474043,Detection of circulating extracellular mRNAs by modified small-RNA-sequencing analysis,"Extracellular mRNAs (ex-mRNAs) potentially supersede extracellular miRNAs (ex-miRNAs) and other RNA classes as biomarkers. We performed conventional small-RNA-sequencing (sRNA-seq) and sRNA-seq with T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) end-treatment of total exRNA isolated from serum and platelet-poor EDTA, ACD, and heparin plasma to study the effect on ex-mRNA capture. Compared to conventional sRNA-seq PNK-treatment increased the detection of informative ex-mRNAs reads up to 50-fold. The exRNA pool was dominated by hematopoietic cells and platelets, with additional contribution from the liver. About 60% of the 15- to 42-nt reads originated from the coding sequences, in a pattern reminiscent of ribosome-profiling. Blood sample type had a considerable influence on the exRNA profile. On average ~350 to 1,100 distinct ex-mRNA transcripts were detected depending on plasma type. In serum, additional transcripts from neutrophils and hematopoietic cells increased this number to near 2,300. EDTA and ACD plasma showed a destabilizing effect on ex mRNA and non-coding RNA ribonucleoprotein complexes compared to other plasma types. In a proof-of-concept study, we investigated differences between the exRNA profiles of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and healthy controls. The improved tissue resolution of ex mRNAs after PNK-treatment enabled us to detect a neutrophil-signature in ACS that escaped detection by ex miRNA analysis."

PRJNA473925,A Novel Class of MicroRNA Recognition Elements That Function Only in Open Reading Frames,"MicroRNA (miRNA) are well known to target 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR) in mRNAs to silence gene expression at post-transcriptional levels. Multiple reports have also indicated the capability of miRNAs to target protein-coding sequences (CDS); however, miRNAs have been generally believed to function in a similar mechanism(s) regardless of the location of their action sites. We herein report a class of miRNA recognition elements (MREs) that exclusively function in CDS regions in humans. Through functional and mechanistic characterization of these “unusual” MREs, we demonstrate that CDS-targeted miRNAs require extensive base pairings in the 3' side rather than the 5' seed; cause gene silencing in an Argonaute-dependent, but GW182-independent manner; and repress translation by inducing transient ribosome stalling instead of mRNA destabilization. These findings reveal distinct mechanisms and functional consequences for miRNAs to target CDS versus 3'UTR and suggest that CDS-targeted miRNAs may enlist a translational quality control (QC)-related mechanism to regulate translation in mammalian cells.

PRJNA473812,NF-Y controls fidelity of transcription initiation at gene promoters through maintenance of the nucleosome-depleted region,"Faithful transcription initiation is critical for accurate gene expression, yet the mechanisms underlying specific transcription start site (TSS) selection in mammals remain unclear. Here, we show that the histone-fold domain protein NF-Y, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, controls the fidelity of transcription initiation at gene promoters. We report that NF-Y maintains the region upstream of TSSs in a nucleosome-depleted state while simultaneously protecting this accessible region against aberrant and/or ectopic transcription initiation. We find that loss of NF-Y binding in mammalian cells disrupts the promoter chromatin landscape, leading to nucleosomal encroachment over the canonical TSS. Importantly, this chromatin rearrangement is accompanied by upstream relocation of the transcription pre-initiation complex and ectopic transcription initiation. Further, this phenomenon generates aberrant extended transcripts that undergo translation, disrupting gene expression profiles. These results demonstrate that NF-Y is a central player in TSS selection in metazoans and highlight the deleterious consequences of inaccurate transcription initiation. Overall design: MNase-Seq, RNA-Seq, Start-Seq, Ribo-Seq, and ATAC-seq experiments on control knockdown (KD) and NF-YA KD mouse ESCs."
PRJNA473808,RNA m6A-Ythdf1 in dendritic cells triggers anti-tumor immunity (ribo-seq and m6a-seq in GMDCs),"Emerging evidence emphasizes the important role of tumor neoantigen in generating the spontaneous antitumor immune response and predicting the clinical response to immunotherapies. Despite the presence of numerous neoantigens, complete tumor elimination rarely occurs in majority of patients due to failures in mounting a sufficient and lasting antitumor immunity. Here we show that the durable neoanitgen-specific immunity is regulated by a m6A-binding protein, Ythdf1. In contrast to wild-type mice, Ythdf1-deficient (Ythdf1-/-) mice generate more antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response for persistent tumor control. Loss of Ythdf1 in dendritic cell (DC) results in an enhanced cross-presentation of tumor antigen and cross-priming of CD8+ T cell in vivo. To confirm our observations, we performed Ribo-Seq to analyze the translational efficiency of genes in DCs and performed m6A-seq to locate the m6A sites. Overall design: BMDCs obtained from WT and YTHDF1 KO mice were used to genetarate ribo-seq (monosome footprints and polysome footprints) and m6a-seq libraries. Two replicates for each conditions."
PRJNA472989,A rare-codon-based translational program of cell proliferation,"The speed of translation elongation is primarily determined by the abundance of tRNAs. Thus, the codon usage influences the rate with which individual mRNAs are translated. As the nature of tRNA pools and modifications can vary across biological conditions, codon elongation rates may also vary, leading to fluctuations in the protein production from individual mRNAs. Although it has been observed that functionally-related mRNAs exhibit similar codon usage, presumably to provide an effective way to coordinate expression of multiple proteins, experimental evidence for codon-mediated translation efficiency modulation of functionally-related mRNAs in specific conditions is scarce and the associated mechanisms are still debated. Here, we reveal that mRNAs whose expression increases during cell proliferation are enriched in rare codons, poorly adapted to tRNA pools. Ribosome occupancy profiling and proteomics measurements show that upon increased cell proliferation, transcripts enriched in rare codons undergo a higher translation boost than transcripts with common codons. Re-coding of a fluorescent reporter with rare codons increased protein output by ~30% relative to a reporter re-coded with common codons. Although the translation capacity of proliferating cells was higher compared to resting cells, we did not find evidence for regulation of individual tRNAs. Among the models that were proposed so far to account for codon-mediated translational regulation upon changing conditions, the one that seems most consistent with our data involves a global upregulation of ready-to-translate tRNAs, which we show can lead to higher increase in the elongation velocity at rare codons compared to common codons. We propose that alleviation of translation bottlenecks in rapidly dividing cells enables preferential upregulation of pro-proliferation proteins, encoded by mRNAs that are enriched in rare codons."

PRJNA472972,Nascent Polypeptide Domain Topology and Elongation Rate Direct the Cotranslational Hierarchy of Hsp70 and TRiC/CCT,"Folding newly synthesized proteins relies on the ribosome intricately coordinating mRNA translation with a network of ribosome-associated machinery. The principles that drive the coordination of this diverse machinery remain poorly understood. Here, we use selective ribosome profiling to determine how the essential chaperonin TRiC/CCT and the Hsp70 Ssb are recruited to ribosome-nascent chain complexes to mediate cotranslational protein folding. Whereas substrate localization and nascent chain sequence are the major determinants of cotranslational recruitment of Ssb, we found that temporal and structural elements drive TRiC engagement. For both chaperones, however, local slowdowns in translation enhance chaperone enrichment. This work helps define the principles that dictate the coordinated activity of ribosome-associated factors to perform their critical role in maintaining a properly folded nascent proteome. Overall design: Replicate ribosome profiling libraries were prepared of immunoprecipitated TRiC/CCT- and Ssb-bound ribosome nascent chain complexes compared to the total ribosome pool, using wild-type yeast and yeast harboring the atp2-P353A,P355A mutations. Additional ribosome profiling libraries were prepared to monitor translation kinetics in yeast not treated with cycloheximide."
PRJNA472636,Nutrient deprivation elicits a transcriptional and translational inflammatory response coupled to decreased protein synthesis,"Purpose: The goal of this study is to examine gene expression regulation at the transcriptional and translational levels in response to various forms of nutrient deprivation, and whether there are differences between isogenic transformed and non-transformed cells. Mehods: We apply high-throughput sequencing of ribosome footprints (ribosome profiling) and poly(A) RNA (RNA sequencing) in an isogenic pair of transformed (tamoxifen-treated) and non-transformed (ethanol control) MCF10A-ER-Src cells subjected to the metabolic stresses that differentially affect global protein synthesis (Figure 1): deprivation of glutamine (for 30min and 4 hours), glucose (4hours), cysteine/cystine (4hours) or leucine/isoleucine/valine (brach-chain aminoacids - BCAA) (4hours).  The same experiments were also performed in transformed ER-Src MCF10A treated with torin1 (500nM) for 4 hours. Results: Genome-wide translational profiling of glutamine deprived ER-Src MCF10A cells (for 30 minutes) shows increased translation of uORFs-containing mRNAs and down-regulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs, which is followed by increased translation and transcription of cytokine and inflammatory mRNAs (after 4 hours of glutamine deprivation). The transcription and translation of inflammatory and cytokine mRNAs is also stimulated in response to 4 hours deprivation of glucose, cysteine/cystine and BCAA, with the extent of stimulation correlating with the i) decrease in global protein synthesis and ii) down-regulation of all translationally-repressed mRNAs or ribosomal protein mRNAs. Conclusions: Pro-inflammatory gene expression is associated with translational repression in response to short-term nutrient deprivation. Overall design: Ribosome occupancy and mRNAs levels in transformed and non-transformed cells cultured for i) 30 minutes under complete (Ctrl) or glutamine-free (NoQ) DMEM medium, and ii) 4 hours under complete (Ctrl),  glucose-free (NoG), glutamine-free (NoQ), cysteine/cystine-free (NoCys) or leucine, isoleucine, valine (NoBCAA)-free DMEM medium. The translation efficiency (TE) was calculated as the log2 ratio of RPKM measured by ribosome profiling over RPKM measured by RNA-seq. Differences in ribosome occupancy (RO) and TE between the metabolic stress condition and the reference sample (either TAM or EtOH cells grown in complete DMEM) were used to examine the transcriptional and translational changes, respectively. The ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing experiments were performed in duplicate with the exception of RNA-seq at 30 minutes (single experiments), ribosome profiling in cysteine/cystine-deprived EtOH cells (triplicate experiments), and the Torin1 ribosome profiling and RNA-seq (single experiment).

PRJNA464051,Widespread Alterations in Translation Elongation in the Brain of Fmr1 Knock-Out Mice,"FMRP is a polysome-associated RNA-binding protein encoded by Fmr1 and lost in Fragile X syndrome. Increasing evidence suggests that FMRP regulates both translation initiation and elongation, but the gene-specificity of these effects is unclear. To elucidate the effects of FMRP loss on translation, we used ribosome profiling for genome-wide measurements of ribosomal occupancy and positioning in the cortex of Fmr1 knock-out mice. We found a remarkably coherent reduction in ribosome footprint abundance per mRNA for previously identified, high-affinity mRNA binding partners of FMRP, and an increase for terminal oligo-pyrimidine (TOP) motif-containing genes canonically controlled by mTOR-4EBP-eIF4E signaling. Amino acid motif- and gene-level analyses both showed a widespread reduction of translational pausing in Fmr1 knock-out mice. Our findings are consistent with a model of FMRP-mediated regulation of both translation initiation through eIF4E and elongation that is disrupted in Fragile X syndrome.

PRJNA459526,Quantifying the performance and burden of genetic parts controlling translation using Ribo-seq,"Ribosome binding sites and stop codons provide signals for where translation should start and stop, and secondary structures in messenger RNAs can stall ribosomes and induce frameshifting. We develop methods that use ribosome profiling to characterize parts controlling translation in situ. We simultaneously measure translation initiation rates and termination efficiencies across the Escherichia coli genome, in addition to the pausing and frameshifting of ribosomes at a strongly expressed synthetic RNA pseudoknot known to impart significant burden on the cell. We measure the transcriptional and translational response to this synthetic construct and find that sequestering of ribosomes at the pseudoknot leads to a s32-mediated heat-shock response."

We combine polysome profiling of hundreds of thousands of randomized 5' UTRs with deep learning to build a predictive model that relates human 5' UTR sequence to translation. Together with a genetic algorithm, we use the model to engineer new 5? UTRs that accurately target specified levels of ribosome loading, providing the ability to tune sequences for optimal protein expression. We show that the same approach can be extended to chemically modified RNA, an important feature for applications in mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology. We test 35,000 truncated human 5' UTRs and 3,577 naturally-occurring variants and show that the model accurately predicts ribosome loading of these sequences. Finally, we provide evidence of 47 SNVs associated with human diseases that cause a significant change in ribosome loading and thus a plausible molecular basis for disease. Overall design: Polysom profiling and sequencing was performed using a library of 300,000 randomized 5' UTR 50-mers with eGFP used as the CDS. Three RNA chemistries were tested: unmodified, pseudouridine, and 1-methylpseudouridine. These were performed in duplicate (6 samples total).

PRJNA454562,Nociceptor translational profiling reveals the RagA-mTORC1 network as a critical generator of neuropathic pain,"Pain sensing neurons, nociceptors, are key drivers of neuropathic pain. We used translating ribosome  affinity purification (trap) to comprehensively characterize up- and down-regulated mRNA  translation in Scn10a-positive nociceptors in chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. We provide  evidence that an underlying mechanism driving these changes in gene expression is a sustained  mTORC1 activation driven by MNK1-eIF4E signaling. RagA, a GTPase controlling mTORC1 activity, is  identified as a novel target of MNK1-eIF4E signaling, demonstrating a new link between these distinct  signaling pathways. Neuropathic pain and RagA translation are strongly attenuated by genetic  ablation of eIF4E phosphorylation, MNK1 elimination or treatment with the MNK inhibitor eFT508. We  reveal a novel translational circuit for the genesis of neuropathic pain with important implications for  next generation neuropathic pain therapeutics. Overall design: Examination of paired unbiased mRNA profile and mRNA profile based on eGFP + L10a (RPL10A) pulldown (TRAP assay) for normal mouse DRG (4 assays / replicates) and DRG from CIPN (Paclitaxel) model mouse (5 assays, 2 pooled to make 4 replicates) Associated NIH grants: R01NS065926 (TJP), R01NS098826 (TJP and GD), R01CA200263 (PMD) and R01NS100788 (ZTC)"

Overall design: 6 replicates of basal mouse cortex (Control, C), 6 replicates for stressed mouse cortex (4 h after 15 min of restraint stress, Stress, S)."
PRJNA453915,Translational control through differential ribosome pausing during amino acid limitation in mammalian cells,"Limitation for amino acids is thought to regulate translation in mammalian cells primarily by signaling through the kinases mTORC1 and GCN2. We find that limitation for the amino acid arginine causes a selective loss of tRNA charging, which regulates translation through ribosome pausing at two of six arginine codons. Interestingly, limitation for leucine, an essential and abundant amino acid in protein, results in little or no ribosome pausing. Chemical and genetic perturbation of mTORC1 and GCN2 signaling revealed that their robust response to leucine limitation prevents ribosome pausing, while an insufficient response to arginine limitation led to loss of arginine tRNA charging and ribosome pausing. Codon-specific ribosome pausing decreased protein production and triggered premature ribosome termination without significantly reducing mRNA levels. Together, our results suggest that amino acids which are not optimally sensed by the mTORC1 and GCN2 pathways still regulate translation through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism based on synonymous codon usage. Overall design: Ribosome profiling was performed in HEK293T, HCT116, or HeLa cells during limitation for leucine or arginine for 3 or 6 hours to determine the effect of limiting single amino acid levels of ribosome elongation kinetics at the cognate codons. The same cell lines grown in nutrient-rich conditions were used as a control. These experiments were repeated in HEK293T cells with 250 nM Torin1, in cells stably expressing a flag-tagged wild-type or Q99L mutant RagB-GTPase or hrGFP, and in a GCN2 knockout cell line to determine the role of the mTORC1 and GCN2 pathways."
PRJNA453686,EIF1AX-A113 splice and RAS mutations cooperate to drive thyroid tumorigenesis through ATF4 and c-MYC,"Translation initiation in higher eukaryotes is orchestrated by the tight regulation of the cap binding and the 43S pre-initiation complexes (PIC). The PIC component eukaryotic initiation factor 1A (EIF1A), encoded on human chromosomes X and Y by EIF1AX and EIF1AY, respectively, is essential for recruitment of the ternary complex and for assembling the 43S PIC, which after recruitment onto capped mRNAs scans their 5'UTR and localizes the AUG to initiate translation. Recurrent EIF1AX mutations are found in several cancers, including ~1% of papillary thyroid cancers in a mutually exclusive manner with other drivers (BRAF, RAS, and oncogenic fusions). They are enriched in advanced thyroid cancers (11%) where they display a striking co-occurrence with RAS, which we show cooperate to induce tumorigenesis in mouse models and in isogenic cell lines. The C-terminal tail EIF1AX-A113splice mutation is the most prevalent in advanced thyroid cancer, and private to this disease. We found that EIF1AX-A113spl variants stabilize the PIC and induces ATF4 expression, a sensor of cellular stress, which is co-opted to suppress EIF-2a phosphorylation, thus enabling a general increase in protein synthetic rate. RAS stabilizes c-MYC, an effect augmented by EIF1AX-A113spl. ATF4 and c-MYC induce expression of aminoacid transporters, and enhance sensitivity of mTOR to aminoacid supply. These mutually reinforcing events generate therapeutic vulnerabilities to MEK, BRD4 and mTOR kinase inhibitors. The RNA-Seq and Ribosome Profiling samples provided here were used to support the claim of increased translational efficiency of ATF4. Overall design: Comparison of Ribosome footprints in the context of EIF1AX-splice mutated (C643) and splice reverted isogenic cell line (C643-spl- rev), three replicates of ribosome-protected RNA sequencing and three replicates of RNA-seq were used. Additionally, 3 replicates of RNA-seq comparing KRAS G12R mutant CAL62 vs. CAL62-splice, an isogenic cell line generated with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knock in of EIF1AX-splice mutation."
PRJNA451682,Peroxisome function relies on organelle-associated mRNA translation,"Crucial metabolic functions of peroxisomes rely on a variety of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs). While mRNA transcripts of PMPs were shown to be colocalized with peroxisomes, the process by which PMPs efficiently couple translation with targeting to the peroxisomal membrane remained elusive. Here, we combine quantitative electron microscopy with proximity-specific ribosome profiling and reveal that translation of specific PMPs occurs on the surface of peroxisomes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This places peroxisomes alongside chloroplasts, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum as organelles that use localized translation for ensuring correct insertion of hydrophobic proteins into their membranes. Moreover, the correct targeting of these transcripts to peroxisomes is crucial for peroxisomal and cellular function, emphasizing the importance of localized translation for cellular physiology. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of whole cell or streptavidin-purified ribosomes biotinylated by peroxisome-localized biotin ligase in yeast."
PRJNA450728,Inverse toeprinting: a new tool to decipher the translational arrest code,"While it has become increasingly apparent that the amino acid sequence of a nascent polypeptide can modulate its rate of synthesis, tools to decipher the underlying translational arrest code are still lacking. Here, we present inverse toeprinting, a new method to map the position of bacterial ribosomes arrested on messenger RNAs during in vitro translation. Unlike the widely used ribosome profiling approach, our method protects the entire coding region upstream of a stalled ribosome, making it possible to work with transcripts of unknown sequence. To demonstrate this, we use inverse toeprinting to characterize the pausing landscape of free and drug-bound ribosomes engaged in translation of a random transcript library. The arrest motifs that we identified correlate well with previous in vivo profiling data. Inverse toeprinting also allows us to determine the pause strength of individual motifs and thus provides a means to decipher the bacterial arrest code that can be adapted to other sequence-dependent translational processes."

PRJNA448921,DDX6 decouples translational repression from RNA degradation of miRNA targets [Ribosome Profiling],"Translation and mRNA degradation are intimately connected, yet the mechanisms that regulate them are not fully understood. Here we examine the regulation of translation and mRNA stability in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and during differentiation. In contrast to previous reports, we found that transcriptional changes account for most of the molecular changes during ESC differentiation. Within ESCs translation level and mRNA stability are positively correlated. The RNA-binding protein DDX6 has been implicated in processes involving both translational repression and mRNA destabilization; in yeast DDX6 connects codon optimality and mRNA stability and in mammals DDX6 is involved in microRNA-mediated repression. We generated DDX6 KO ESCs and found that while there was minimal connection between codon usage and stability changes, the loss of DDX6 leads to the translational depression of microRNA targets. Surprisingly, the translational derepression of microRNA targets occurs without affecting mRNA stability. Furthermore, DDX6 KO ESCs share overlapping phenotypes and global molecular changes with ESCs that completely lack all microRNAs. Together our results demonstrate that the loss of DDX6 decouples the two forms of microRNA induced repression and emphasize that translational repression by microRNAs is underappreciated. Overall design: Ribosome profilling was performed on mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and Epiblast like cells (EpiLCs)."
PRJNA448763,Landscapes of gene translation in hepatocellular carcinoma tumors revealed by ribosome profiling,"Despite the critical role of translation in the multi-level gene expression regulation program that controls the protein abundance, a high-resolution view on the landscapes of gene translation in cancer has been missing. We used the technique of ribosome profiling to dissect the translatomes of human liver tumors and their adjacent normal tissues. Our results, as a novel resource, revealed genome-wide abnormalities of translation efficiencies in tumors and context-dependent non-canonical ORFs. Overall design: We profiled the paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples from 10 patients of HCC by the procedure of ribosome profiling, which was adapted and optimized for processing of clinical solid tissue samples. Total RNA sequencing was performed in parallel for the same samples."
PRJNA448601,Effects of single amino acid deficiency on mRNA translation are markedly different for methionine versus leucine,"Amino acid availability regulates translation through the action of the GCN2 and mTORC1 pathways. Low amino acids activate the eIF2a kinase GCN2 through binding of uncharged tRNAs to a histidyl-tRNA synthetase-related regulatory domain. Once activated GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2a, inhibiting ternary complex formation and translation initiation. Recent studies show that mTORC1 is particularly sensitive to arginine and leucine status, with a deprivation of these amino acids leading to a strong inhibition of mTORC1 that prevents the phosphorylation and inactivation of the translational repressor 4EBP1. Though amino acids are known regulators of translation, the effects that deficiencies of specific amino acids have on translation have yet to be determined. We demonstrate that deprivation of leucine or methionine results in large inhibitory effects on translation initiation and on polysome formation that are not replicated by overexpressing non-phosphorylatable 4EBP1 or a phosphomimetic eIF2a. Our results demonstrate that a lack of either leucine or methionine has a major impact on mRNA translation, though they act by quite different mechanisms. Leucine deprivation appears to primarily inhibit ribosome loading, whereas methionine deprivation appears to primarily impair start site recognition. These data point to a unique regulatory effect that methionine status has on translation initiation. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of single Amino acid starvation"
PRJNA448005,Regulatory Discrimination of mRNAs by FMRP Controls Adult Neural Stem Cell Differentiation,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a translation-inhibitor RNA binding protein. The impact of FMRP-deficiency on neural function is widespread, including its regulation of adult neural stem cell (aNSC) differentiation. To assess FMRP activity, we performed ribosome profiling of aNSCs from normal and Fmr1 knockout mice, which revealed diverse gene expression changes at the mRNA and translation levels. Many mitosis and neurogenesis genes were dysregulated primarily at the mRNA level, while numerous synaptic genes were mostly dysregulated at the translation level. Translational “buffering” was also evident, whereby changes in ribosome association with mRNA is compensated by alterations in RNA abundance. Our data revealed that FMRP-regulated neurogenesis is mediated by the transcriptional factor necdin and that FMRP determines mitochondrial mRNA expression and energy homeostasis. Thus, FMRP controls diverse transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression programs critical for the adult neural stem cell differentiation. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq of wild type (WT) and Fmr1 -/y mouse adult neural stem cells were generated from four biological replicates using Illumina Nextseq."

PRJNA445600,Post-transcriptional regulation of the epithelial cell response to colitis,"Aim: RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are emerging as critical regulators of gut homeostasis via post-transcriptional control of key growth and repair pathways. IMP1 (IGF2 mRNA Binding Protein 1) is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development and Imp1 hypomorphic mice exhibit severe gut growth defects. In the present study, we investigated the mechanistic contribution of intestinal epithelial IMP1 to gut homeostasis and response to injury. Method: We evaluated IMP1 expression in patients with Crohn's disease followed by unbiased ribosome profiling in IMP1 knockout cells. Concurrently, we measured differences in histology and cytokine expression in mice with intestinal epithelial-specific Imp1 deletion (Imp1?IEC) following dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)- colitis. Based on ribosome profiling analysis, we evaluated changes in autophagy in Imp1?IEC mice as well as in silico and in vitro approaches to evaluate direct protein:RNA interactions. Finally, we analyzed the consequence of genetic deletion of Atg7 in Imp1?IEC mice using colitis and irradiation models. Results: IMP1 was robustly upregulated in Crohn's disease patients and Imp1 loss lessened DSS-colitis severity. Unbiased ribosome-profiling revealed that IMP1 may coordinate translation of multiple pathways important for intestinal homeostasis, including cell cycle and autophagy, which we verified by Western blotting. Mechanistically, we observed evidence for increased autophagy flux in Imp1?IEC mice, reinforced through in silico and biochemical analyses revealing direct binding of IMP1 to autophagy transcripts. Finally, we found genetic deletion of Atg7 reversed the phenotype observed in DSS- or irradiation-challenged Imp1?IEC mice. Conclusions: IMP1 acts as a post-transcriptional regulator of gut epithelial repair, in part through modulation of autophagy. This study highlights the need for examining post-transcriptional regulation as a critical mechanism in inflammatory bowel disease.

PRJNA445453,Transcriptome Mapping of Internal N7-methylguanosine Methylome in Mammalian mRNA,"N7-methylguanosine (m7G) is a positively charged, essential modification at the 5' cap of eukaryotic mRNA, regulating mRNA export, translation, and splicing. m7G also occurs internally within tRNA and rRNA, but its existence and distribution within eukaryotic mRNA remain to be investigated. Here, we show the presence of internal m7G sites within mammalian mRNA. We then performed transcriptome-wide profiling of internal m7G methylome using m7G-MeRIP sequencing (MeRIP-seq). To map this modification at base resolution, we developed a chemical-assisted sequencing approach that selectively converts internal m7G sites into abasic sites, inducing misincorporation at these sites during reverse transcription. This base-resolution m7G-seq enabled transcriptome-wide mapping of m7G in human tRNA and mRNA, revealing distribution features of the internal m7G methylome in human cells. We also identified METTL1 as a methyltransferase that installs a subset of m7G within mRNA and showed that internal m7G methylation could affect mRNA translation. Overall design: [dataset 1] 12 samples. Duplicates for PAR-CLIP of METTL1 and WDR4 in HeLa cell line. Duplicates for PAR-CLIP of eIF4E, RNMT, METTL1 and WDR4 in HEK293T cell line.

Duplicates for m7G-seq of small RNA (<200 nt) and mRNA samples, including three sections of RNA input, before_pulldown, and pulldown in HeLa, HepG2, and HEK293T cell lines. [dataset 4] 38 samples. Duplicates for m7G-MeRIP-seq (anti-m7G antibody, MBL) of cell mRNA samples, including two sections of RNA input and IP in HeLa, HepG2, HEK293T, MEF and mESC wild-type cell lines; also in HeLa cell siControl vs siMETTL1, and HepG2 cell shControl vs shMETTL1."
PRJNA445295,Translation elongation rate varies among organs and decreases with age,"There has been a surge of interest towards targeting protein synthesis to treat diseases and extend lifespan. Despite the progress, few options are available to assess translation in live animals, as their complexity limits the repertoire of experimental tools to monitor and manipulate processes within organs and individual cells. It this study, we developed a labeling-free method for measuring organ- and cell-type-specific translation elongation rates in vivo. It is based on time-resolved delivery of translation initiation and elongation inhibitors in live animals followed by ribosome profiling. It also reports translation initiation sites in an organ-specific manner. Using this method, we found that the elongation rates differ more than 50% among mouse organs and determined them to be 6.8, 5.0, and 4.3 amino acids per second for liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle, respectively. We further found that the elongation rate is reduced by 20% between young adulthood and mid-life. Thus, translation, a major metabolic process in cells, is tightly regulated at the level of elongation of nascent polypeptide chains. Overall design: Measuring translation elongation rate in three organs (heart, kidney, skeletal muscle) and two ages (15 and 72 weeks), three timepoints per each organ, 2-4 replicated per a timepoint."

Polysome associated mRNAs from oenocyte were extracted from young flies and aged flies, treated with water or paraquat. Restults provide insight into aging mechanism and tissue specific response to stress in oenocyte. Overall design: Drosophila melanogaster expressing FLAG tagged Rpl13A under oneocyte driver (PromE-Gal4 > Rpl13A-FLAG) was used in the experiment. Samples were collected in three replicate from sexually-mature freely-mated adults. Young (1-2 weeks old) and aged (4 weeks old) adults were transferred on control food or paraquat (10mM) food for 24 hours prior to mRNA extraction.

PRJNA439265,Codon usage optimization in pluripotent embryonic stem cells [RNA-seq],"The uneven use of synonymous codons in the transcriptome regulates the efficiency and fidelity of protein translation rates. Yet, the importance of this codon bias on regulating cell state-specific expression programs is currently debated. Here, we asked whether the gene expression program in the well-defined cell states of self-renewal and differentiation in embryonic stem cells is driven by optimized codon usage. Using ribosome and transcriptome profiling, we identified distinct codon signatures for human self-renewing and differentiating embryonic stem cells. One driver for the cell state-specific codon bias was the genomic GC-content of the differentially expressed genes and thus, determined by transcription rather than translation. However, by measuring the codon frequencies at the ribosome's active sites interacting with transfer RNAs (tRNA), we discovered that the wobble position tRNA modification inosine strongly influenced the codon optimization in self-renewing embryonic stem cells. This effect was conserved in mice and independent of the differentiation stimulus. In summary, we newly reveal how translational mechanisms based on RNA modifications can shape optimized codon usage in embryonic stem cells.  Overall design: Ribosome profiling and total RNA from self-renewing and differentiating human H9 cells, 4 biological replicates per condition"

PRJNA438895,Divergent rRNAs as regulators of gene expression at the ribosome level,"It is generally assumed that each organism has evolved to possess a unique ribosomal RNA (rRNA) species optimal for its physiological needs. However, some organisms express divergent rRNAs, the functional roles of which remain unknown. Here, we show that ribosomes containing the most variable rRNAs, encoded by the rrnI operon (herein designated I-ribosomes), direct the preferential translation of a subset of mRNAs in Vibrio vulnificus, enabling the rapid adaptation of bacteria to temperature and nutrient shifts. In addition, genetic and functional analyses of I-ribosomes and target mRNAs suggest that both I-ribosomal subunits are required for the preferential translation of specific mRNAs, the Shine-Dalgarno sequences of which do not play a critical role in I-ribosome binding. This study identifies genome-encoded divergent rRNAs as regulators of gene expression at the ribosome level, providing an additional level of regulation of gene expression in bacteria in response to environmental changes. Overall design: Ribosome profiling analysis. Cells were grown at 30 °C in LBS media containing 0.2 µg/ml tetracycline (Tc) to an OD600 of 0.7. After treatment with 100 µg/ml chloramphenicol to stop translation, the cells were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The culture was cooled on ice and harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was washed with pre-chilled buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NH4Cl, 6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM EDTA) containing 1 mM of chloramphenicol and was lysed using a French press. Cellular debris was removed by centrifuging for 30 min at 30,000 × g. The clarified lysate (supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2) was digested with micrococcal nuclease for 1 h at 25 °C and quenched with EGTA to a final concentration of 6 mM. The resulting lysate was loaded onto a 30% sucrose cushion. Crude ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended and loaded onto a 15–40% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 79,500 × g for 13.5 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, monosomes were obtained by fractionation and measurement of optical density at 260 nm. Monosomal RNA was obtained by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and was resuspended in RNase-free water. To obtain ribosome-protected mRNAs, extracted monosomal RNA was resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide-8 M urea-TBE gel. A band between 28 and 42 bp was excised, gel puri?ed, precipitated, and resuspended in RNase-free water. For ribosomal RNA depletion the Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated RNAs were used to construct a cDNA library for Illumina sequencing using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using single-end 50 bp sequencing. Transcriptome analysis. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells grown at 30 °C in LBS media containing 0.2 µg/ml tetracycline (Tc) to an OD600 of 0.7 using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA in total RNA was converted into a library of template molecules suitable for subsequent cluster generation using the reagents provided in the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit. The first step in the workflow involves removing the rRNA in the total RNA using Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal kit. Following this step, the remaining mRNA is fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA fragments are copied into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. This is followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. These cDNA fragments then go through an end repair process, the addition of a single 'A' base, and then ligation of the adapters. The products are then purified and enriched with PCR to create the final cDNA library. RNA sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using paired-end 100 bp sequencing. Sequencing data analysis. The sequence of the reference genome was retrieved from the NCBI database. RNA-seq reads were aligned to the reference genome sequence using Bowtie2 or BWA. Coordinates of mapped reads were obtained by processing BAM formatted files using BEDOPS tools and were stored in BED formatted files. Coordinates of genome features such as protein coding genes were extracted from the genome annotation data. Boundaries of features such as transcription start sites and gene segments were prepared: a transcription start site was defined as positions from -60 to +60 (the first nucleotide of a start codon was numbered as +1) and a gene segment as positions from -60 to the end of the stop codon. Overlapping genome-mapped RNA-seq reads were assigned to these features. The normalized abundance of reads was measured as number of reads per million mapped reads (RPM)."

PRJNA437439,Transcriptome-wide interrogation of the functional intronome by spliceosome profiling,"Full understanding of eukaryotic transcriptomes and how they respond to different conditions requires deep knowledge of all sites of intron excision. Although RNA-Seq provides much of this information, the low abundance of many spliced transcripts (often due to their rapid cytoplasmic decay) limits the ability of RNA-Seq alone to reveal the full repertoire of spliced species. Here we present spliceosome profiling, a strategy based on deep sequencing of RNAs co-purifying with late stage spliceosomes. Spliceosome profiling allows for unambiguous mapping of intron ends to single nucleotide resolution and branchpoint identification at unprecedented depths. Our data reveal hundreds of new introns in S. pombe and numerous others that were previously misannotated. By providing a means to directly interrogate sites of spliceosome assembly and catalysis genome-wide, spliceosome profiling promises to transform our understanding of RNA processing in the nucleus much like ribosome profiling has transformed our understanding mRNA translation in the cytoplasm."

Here we combine SLAM-seq, a novel method for direct quantification of newly synthesized mRNAs, with pharmacological and rapid chemical-genetic perturbation to interrogate primary transcriptional targets of BRD4 and MYC and define the response to BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi). While BRD4 acts as a global co-activator of Pol2-dependent transcription in a BET bromodomain-dependent manner, therapeutic BETi doses deregulate a small set of hypersensitive target genes. In contrast to BRD4, MYC primarily acts as a selective transcriptional activator that controls basic metabolic processes such as ribosome biogenesis and de-novo purine synthesis across diverse cancer contexts. Beyond defining primary regulatory functions of BRD4 and MYC in cancer, our study establishes a simple, robust and scalable approach to dissect direct transcriptional targets of any gene or pathway.

We revealed tRNA halves as one of the most strongly affected classes of transcripts upregulated during nutrient deprivation and stationary phase. In particular, the abundance of the tRNAThr 3' half was significantly increased and it was found to interact with ribosomes and polysomes upon starvation. This particular tRNA half-ribosome interaction stimulates protein biosynthesis in vitro as well as in vivo and appears to play a role primarily during the stress recovery phase of T. brucei."

This study includes a total of 32 samples comprised of 16 RNA-Seq samples (mRNA) and 16 ribosome footprint profiling samples (ribo). Experiment 1 includes 8 samples, comprised of 4 RNA-Seq samples and 4 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from 2 biological replicates each of the dbp1?  and ded1-ts dbp1? mutant strains, cultured in synthetic complete (SC) medium, following shifts in growth temperature from 30°C to 37°C for 2h.  Experiment 2 examines the effect of overexpression of DBP1 in rescuing genome-wide translational defects of a ded1-cs mutant (cold-sensitive allele of DED1) and includes 12 samples, 6 RNA-Seq samples and 6 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from 2 biological replicates each of WT DED1 (dubbed DED1-CS), ded1-cs and ded1-cs overexpressing DBP1 (ded1-cs_hcDBP1) strains, cultured in SC-Leu-His medium, following shifts in growth temperature from 30°C to 15°C for 10 min.

PRJNA434112,Ribosome profiling uncovers selective mRNA translation associated with eIF2 phosphorylation in erythroid progenitors,The aim of this study is to investigate how eIF2 phosphorylation affects mRNA translation in erythroblasts. Ribosome profiling combined with RNA sequencing was used to determine translation initiation sites and ribosome density on individual transcripts. Overall design: Ribosome profiling samples with translation halted by harringtonine (ribosome stalls at start site) or cyclohexamide (ribosome is frozen at current location) were treated with tunicamycin to induce eIF2 phosphorylation vs untreated. Total RNAseq sample with and without tunicamcyin were also generated. Total RNAseq and cycolhexamide were used to calculate ribosome occupancy as a measure of translation efficiency. Harringtonin peaks were used to identify alternative sites of translation initiation under stress.

PRJNA433501,Impact of G-content on Arabidopsis AtPAB binding and their role in enhancing translational efficiency,"Polyadenylation plays a key role in producing mature mRNAs in eukaryotes. It is widely believed that the poly(A)-binding proteins (PABs) uniformly bind to poly(A)-tailed mRNAs, regulating their stability and translational efficiency. Here, we characterized the RNA-binding landscape of three broadly expressed PABs in Arabidopsis thaliana. We observed substantial variation in the AtPAB-binding efficiency among mRNAs, which can be partly explained by the guanosine (G) content of poly(A) tails. AtPAB-binding efficiency of a gene was positively associated with translational efficiency rather than mRNA stability. Consistently, genes with stronger AtPAB binding exhibited a greater reduction in translational efficiency when AtPAB is depleted. Our study provides a new mechanism that translational efficiency of a gene can be regulated through G-content-dependent PAB binding, paving the way for a better understanding of poly(A) tail-associated regulation of gene expression. Overall design: CLIP-seq and ribosome profiling were used to study direct binding genes and the functions on translational regulation of AtPABs. Poly(A)-seq was used to detect the mRNA tail information in Col. Degradtion data was used to detect mRNA degradation rate in Col."
PRJNA432508,Global identification of functional microRNA-mRNA interactions in Drosophila,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key mediators of post-transcriptional gene expression silencing. So far, no comprehensive experimental annotation of functional miRNA target sites exists in Drosophila. To close this gap, we generated the first transcriptome-wide in vivo map of miRNA-mRNA interactions in Drosophila melanogaster, making use of single nucleotide resolution in Argonaute1 (AGO1) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data. Absolute quantification of cellular miRNA levels presents the miRNA pool in Drosophila cell lines to be more diverse than previously reported. Benchmarking two CLIP approaches, we identify a similar predictive potential to unambiguously assign thousands of miRNA-mRNA pairs from AGO1 interaction data at unprecedented depth, achieving higher signal-to-noise ratios than with computational methods alone. Quantitative RNA-Seq and sub-codon resolution ribosomal footprinting data upon AGO1 depletion enabled the determination of miRNA-mediated effects on target expression and translation. We thus provide the first comprehensive resource of miRNA target sites and their quantitative functional impact in Drosophila. Overall design: 1) Endogenous AGO1 PARCLIP and HITSCLIP small RNA sequencing data of wt Drosophila S2 cells. 2) smallRNA-seq data of endogenously 5'phosphorylated small RNA species wt Drosophila S2 cells. 3) Stranded, single-end, rRNA-depleted RNA-seq data upon dsRNA-mediated knockdown of AGO1 and control treatments. 4) Matched ribosomal footprinting data upon dsRNA-mediated knockdown of AGO1 and control treatments."
PRJNA432322,Potassium tellurite exerts its toxicity on ribosome in Escherichia coli,"Purpose: We use the ribosome profiling protocol to understand why EF4 confers resistance to tellurite and how tellurite affects ribosome. Methods: We used ribosome profiling and transcriptomic data to analyze mainly by plastid software. The ribosome were purified by sucrose gradient separation. Results: Using polysome profile and sequencing data, we found that tellurite disables the ribosome subunits to form a functional 70S ribosome and reduces the ribosome density after tellurite exposure. We also found that tellurite influences the ribosome reaching to stop codon. Tellurite shortened the ribosome protected fragment, this process was mediated by EF4. EF4 mediated more gene expression including these known tellurite resistance genes to confer tellurite resistance. Tellurite also induced many differential gene expression. Conclusions: Tellurite exerts its toxicity on ribosome by disabling 70S ribosome formation, reaching to stop codon, and inducing differential gene expression. Overall design: Ribosome footprints and mRNAs from BW25113 (WT) and JW2553 (?EF4) strains that were treated with potassium tellurite and sequenced, in two replicates, using Illumina HiSeq 2500"

By using an auxin-inducible degron, we were able to study immediate effects of Xrn1 depletion in translational control. Therefore, we could overcome experimental limitations associated to stable deletion mutants. Overall design: mRNA and ribosome footprints were obtained as described in (Ingolia, 2009) from BY25598 cells (Nishimura and Kanemaki, 2014) modified to express an Xrn1 protein tagged with an auxin inducible degron (AID). Libraries were obtained from cells treated with auxin for 30 minutes (t30) and compared from libraries from untreated controls (t0). After 30 minutes of treatment, Xrn1 protein was reduced to less than 10%. For the Xrn1-D208A mutant, a BY4741 background was used. Wild-type and mutant strains were grown to logarithmic phase and collected at approximately 0.5 OD."

We also profile the effect of LIN28B expression on transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy in HEK293A via RNA-seq. Finally, we provide orthogonal regulatory data by profiling the effect of LIN28B expression on transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy in NIH3T3 via RNA-seq.

PRJNA430526,Lso2 is a conserved ribosome-bound protein required for translational recovery in yeast,"Ribosome binding proteins function broadly in protein synthesis, gene regulation and cellular homeostasis but the complete complement of functional ribosome-bound proteins remains unknown. Using quantitative mass spectrometry we identified Late-annotated short open reading frame 2 (Lso2) as a ribosome-associated protein that is broadly conserved in eukaryotes. Genome-wide crosslinking and immunoprecipitation of Lso2 and its human ortholog CCDC124 recovered 25S rRNA in a region near the A site that overlaps the GTPase activating center. Consistent with this location, Lso2 also crosslinked to most tRNAs. Ribosome profiling of yeast lacking LSO2 (lso2?) revealed global translation defects during recovery from stationary phase with translation of most genes reduced more than 4-fold. Ribosomes accumulated at start codons, were depleted from stop codons, and showed codon-specific changes in occupancy in lso2?. These defects, and the conservation of the specific ribosome-binding activity of Lso2/CCDC124, indicate broadly important functions in translation and physiology. Overall design: Enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by deep sequencing: 5 IP samples of Lso2 and CCDC124, 6 controls of size-matched input and untagged IP. Ribosome footprint profiling: 7 samples of wild-type and 7 samples of lso2 null mutants."
PRJNA430238,Ribosome profiling on heat shocked wild type and Mettl14 -/- mES cells,"Abstract : A hallmark of the cellular response to environmental stress is the formation of stress granules.  Stress granules are RNA-protein assemblies that provide an adaptive response to stress; however, the basis for their formation and how they contribute to the stress response remains incompletely understood.  Here we show that the mRNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a mark that targets mRNAs to stress granules.  We find that m6A mRNAs are highly enriched in stress granules, and this is mediated by m6A-induced liquid-liquid phase separation of the YTHDF family of m6A-binding proteins.  These proteins bind poly-methylated m6A mRNAs, causing them to form liquid droplets that partition into stress granules. Moreover, disrupting either m6A or YTHDF proteins prevents stress granule formation.  The goal of this experiment is to understand how recruitment of m6A mRNA to stress granules influences the translational response to heat shock. Result: we found that m6A-containing mRNA are preferentially repressed during stress, and that m6A is required for translational recovery after heat shock Overall design: Ribosome profiling were generated from two biological replicates of wild type and Mettl14 -/- mES cells heat socked at 42°C for 30 min or not and at a recovery time point of 1h after heat shock"

PRJNA429210,"Tma64 (eIF2D), Tma20 (MCT-1), and Tma22 (DENR) recycle post-termination 40S subunits in vivo","The recycling of ribosomal subunits after translation termination is critical for efficient gene expression. Tma64 (eIF2D), Tma20 (MCT-1), and Tma22 (DENR) function as 40S recycling factors in vitro, but it is unknown whether they perform this function in vivo or serve as alternative initiation factors. Ribosome profiling of strains missing these factors revealed 80S ribosomes queued behind the stop codon, consistent with a block in 40S recycling. We found that unrecycled ribosomes could reinitiate translation at AUG codons in the 3'UTR, as evidenced by peaks in the footprint data and 3'UTR reporter analysis. In vitro translation experiments using reporter mRNAs containing upstream ORFs (uORFs) further established that reinitiation increased in the absence of these proteins. In some cases, 40S ribosomes appeared to rejoin with 60S subunits and undergo an alternative 80S reinitiation process in 3'UTRs. These results support a crucial role for Tma64, Tma20, and Tma22 in the recycling of 40S ribosomal subunits at stop codons and translation reinitiation. Overall design: 14 biological samples are included in the study for ribosome footprinting. These include wild-type and combination knockouts of TMA64, TMA20, and TMA22, and mutation of SUI1."

PRJNA428526,"Pervasive, coordinated protein level changes driven by transcript isoform switching during meiosis","To better understand the gene regulatory mechanisms that program developmental processes, we carried out simultaneous, genome-wide measurements of mRNA, translation and protein through meiotic differentiation in budding yeast. Surprisingly, we observed that the levels of several hundred mRNAs are anti-correlated with their corresponding protein products. We show that rather than arising from canonical forms of gene regulatory control, the regulation of at least 380 such cases—or over 8% of all measured genes—involves temporally regulated switching between production of a canonical, translatable transcript and a 5'' extended isoform that is not efficiently translated into protein. By this pervasive mechanism for the modulation of protein levels through a natural developmental program, a single transcription factor can coordinately activate and repress protein synthesis for distinct sets of genes. The distinction is not based on whether an mRNA is induced or not, but rather based on the type of transcript produced. Overall design: Sequencing of mRNA molecules and ribosome footprints to identify regulated transcript isoform changes that result in apparent translational regulation. In short,two major experiments are included here, one for parallel mRNA-seq and ribosome profiling of cells progressing through meiosis. This was performed in parallel with mass spectrometry to ascertain the relationship between transcript abundance, translation, and protein abundance over time in a developmental process. The other experiment investigates the effects on transcript abundance and translation of induction of a single transcription factor (Ndt80). The results and analysis of both studies are in the publication, Pervasive, coordinated protein level changes driven by transcript isoform switching during meiosis by Ze Cheng*, George Maxwell Otto*, Emily Nicole Powers, Abdurrahman Keskin, Philipp Mertins, Steve Carr, Marko Jovanovic, and Gloria Ann Brar.

PRJNA423281,eIF1A residues implicated in cancer stabilize translation preinitiation complexes and favor suboptimal initiation sites in yeast,"The translation pre-initiation complex (PIC) scans the mRNA for an AUG codon in favorable context, and AUG recognition stabilizes a closed PIC conformation. The unstructured N-terminal tail (NTT) of yeast eIF1A deploys five basic residues to contact tRNAi, mRNA, or 18S rRNA exclusively in the closed state. Interestingly, EIF1AX mutations altering the human eIF1A NTT are associated with uveal melanoma (UM). We found that substituting all five basic residues, and seven UM-associated substitutions, in yeast eIF1A suppresses initiation at near-cognate UUG codons and AUGs in poor context. Ribosome profiling of NTT substitution R13P reveals heightened discrimination against unfavorable AUG context genome-wide. Both R13P and K16D substitutions destabilize the closed complex at UUG codons in reconstituted PICs. Thus, electrostatic interactions involving the eIF1A NTT stabilize the closed conformation and promote utilization of suboptimal start codons. We predict UM-associated mutations alter human gene expression by increasing discrimination against poor initiation sites. Overall design: We examined the effect of tif11-R13P on global translational efficiencies (TEs) by ribosome footprint profiling of isogenic WT and tif11-R13P strains. The study includes 8 samples, comprised of 4 mRNA-Seq samples and 4 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from 2 biological replicates of tif11? mutant strains harboring plasmid-borne tif11-R13P or the WT TIF11 allele.

PRJNA421497,Translational control of ERK signalling pathway by the mRNA cap-binding protein 4EHP,"microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing is commonly deregulated in a wide variety of diseases. Therefore, a better understanding of how miRNAs govern the translation and stability of mRNAs is of paramount importance. We recently demonstrated that the cap-binding protein 4EHP is recruited by the miRNA machinery to effect translational repression. However, the impact of 4EHP on regulation of endogenous mRNAs and its role in cell biology is debated. Herein, using the ribosome profiling assay, we identify a subset of endogenous mRNAs that are sensitive to translational repression by 4EHP. We show that expression of DUSP6, a phosphatase that reverses ERK1/2 phosphorylation, is regulated by 4EHP. This regulation, which occurs exclusively at the level of mRNA translation, without affecting the stability of Dusp6 mRNA, is engendered through 4EHP- and miRNA-dependent elements in Dusp6 3´UTR. Consequently, 4EHP protein controls ERK1/2 phosphorylation, promotes cell growth and inhibits apoptosis. Our data reveal a crucial role for translational control mechanisms in the regulation of the ERK pathway. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq in 4EHP KO and WT MEFs."
PRJNA421178,The extent of ribosome queuing in budding yeast,"Ribosome queuing is a fundamental phenomenon suggested to be related to topics such as genome evolution, synthetic biology, gene expression regulation, intracellular biophysics, and more. However, this phenomenon hasn''t been quantified yet at a genomic level. Nevertheless, methodologies for studying translation (e.g. ribosome footprints) are usually calibrated to capture only single ribosome protected footprints (mRPFs) and thus limited in their ability to detect ribosome queuing. On the other hand, most of the models in the field assume and analyze a certain level of queuing.     Here we present an experimental-computational approach for studying ribosome queuing based on sequencing of RNA footprints extracted from pairs of ribosomes (dRPFs) using a modified ribosome profiling protocol. We combine our approach with traditional ribosome profiling to generate a detailed profile of ribosome traffic. The data are analyzed using computational models of translation dynamics.    The approach was implemented on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome. Our data shows that ribosome queuing is more frequent than previously thought: the measured ratio of ribosomes within dRPFs to mRPFs is 0.2-0.35, suggesting that at least one to five translating ribosomes is in a traffic jam; these queued ribosomes cannot be captured by traditional methods.     We found that specific regions are enriched with queued ribosomes, such as the 5'-end of ORFs, and regions upstream to mRPF peaks, among others. While queuing is related to higher density of ribosomes on the transcript (characteristic of highly translated genes), we report cases where traffic jams are relatively more severe in lowly expressed genes and possibly even selected for. In addition, our analysis demonstrates that higher adaptation of the coding region to the intracellular tRNA levels is associated with lower queuing levels. Our analysis also suggests that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome undergoes selection for eliminating traffic jams. Thus, our proposed approach is an essential tool for high resolution analysis of ribosome traffic during mRNA translation and understanding its evolution. Overall design: We present an experimental-computational approach for studying ribosome queuing based on sequencing of RNA footprints extracted from pairs of ribosomes (dRPFs) using a modified ribosome profiling protocol. We combine our approach with traditional ribosome profiling to generate a detailed profile of ribosome traffic. The data are analyzed using computational models of translation dynamics."

Our studies reveals the wide distribution of circRNAs among the subcellular fractions except the mitochondria. Further comparative analysis indicate the differential subcellular distributions in expression, length, GC content, classification, alternative circularization and function of the parental genes. Through analyzing the binding motifs distribution of the transport-related RBPs among the subcellular circRNAs, we found that the different subcellular distribution characteristics of circRNAs might be resulted from the RBP-mediated selective transportation. It also implies that the circRNAs may follow the same transportation mechanism as linear RNAs: the RBPs specially recognize, bind to and transport the RNAs with the corresponding binding motifs, regardless of circular or linear RNAs. Our researches not only facilitate better understanding of the life history and molecular behavior of circRNA in cell, but also contribute to the exploration for new biological functions of circRNA.

Here we integrated mRNA sequencing, ribosome footprinting, polysomal RNA seq and quantitative mass spectrometry datasets obtained from an isogenic mouse lymphoid cell model in order to study the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) associated R98S mutation in ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10 R98S). RPL10 R98S induced changes in protein levels were to a much larger extent caused by transcriptional then translational changes and RPL10 R98S cells showed a gene signature corresponding to deregulation of hematopoietic transcription factors. Phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH), a key enzyme in serine biosynthesis, displayed elevated transcription and translation and was one of the proteins showing the strongest upregulation in RPL10 R98S cells. Increased Psph protein levels were confirmed in RPL10 R98S engineered JURKAT cells and in hematopoietic cell cultures derived from Rpl10 R98S knock-in mice. Moreover, elevated serine and glycine biosynthesis in RPL10 R98S cells was supported by metabolic flux analyses. Analysis of PSPH expression levels in T-ALL patient samples revealed that PSPH upregulation is a generalized phenomenon in this disease, associated with elevated circulating serine and glycine levels. Addition of serine and glycine enhanced survival of stromal and myeloid cells, suggesting supportive effects on the hematopoietic niche. Finally, reduction of PSPH expression levels in T-ALL cell lines suppressed their in vitro proliferation and their capacity to expand in T-ALL xenograft models. In conclusion, transcriptome, translatome and proteome analysis of the RPL10 R98S mutation identified RPL10 R98S driven induction of cellular serine biosynthesis. Whereas serine metabolism has been implicated in cancer via PHGDH amplification, this is the first report supporting dependence of ALL cells on the serine biosynthesis enzyme PSPH.

Increased Psph protein levels were confirmed in RPL10 R98S engineered JURKAT cells and in hematopoietic cell cultures derived from Rpl10 R98S knock-in mice. Moreover, elevated serine and glycine biosynthesis in RPL10 R98S cells was supported by metabolic flux analyses. Analysis of PSPH expression levels in T-ALL patient samples revealed that PSPH upregulation is a generalized phenomenon in this disease, associated with elevated circulating serine and glycine levels. Addition of serine and glycine enhanced survival of stromal and myeloid cells, suggesting supportive effects on the hematopoietic niche. Finally, reduction of PSPH expression levels in T-ALL cell lines suppressed their in vitro proliferation and their capacity to expand in T-ALL xenograft models. In conclusion, transcriptome, translatome and proteome analysis of the RPL10 R98S mutation identified RPL10 R98S driven induction of cellular serine biosynthesis. Whereas serine metabolism has been implicated in cancer via PHGDH amplification, this is the first report supporting dependence of ALL cells on the serine biosynthesis enzyme PSPH.

Here we integrated mRNA sequencing, ribosome footprinting, polysomal RNA seq and quantitative mass spectrometry datasets obtained from an isogenic mouse lymphoid cell model in order to study the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) associated R98S mutation in ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10 R98S).

PRJNA416905,Translation elongation factor 4 (LepA) contributes to tetracycline susceptibility by stalling elongating ribosomes,"Purpose: We use the ribosome profiling protocol to understand EF4 mediated translation events. Methods: We used ribosome profiling data to analyze by plastid software. The ribosome were purified by sucrose gradient separation. Results: Using sequencing data, we found that EF4 mediates the 1-nucleotide conformational change of ribosomes. We also found that many genes involved in translation after tetracycline treatment. Finally, we found that EF4 stalls the elongating ribosomes globally. Conclusions: Our results suggest that EF4 mediates both 30S biogenesis and translation elongation process, in particular, EF4 stalls the elongating ribosomes globally. Overall design: Ribosome footprints from WT and ?EF4 strains and the two strains treated with tetracycline were sequenced, in two replicates, using Illumina HiSeq 2500."

PRJNA416316,Defining the physiological role of SRP in protein-targeting efficiency and specificity,"The signal recognition particle (SRP) enables cotranslational delivery of proteins for translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but its full in vivo role remains incompletely explored. We combined rapid auxin-induced SRP degradation with proximity-specific ribosome profiling to define SRP's in vivo function in yeast. Despite the classic view that SRP recognizes amino-terminal signal sequences, we show that SRP was generally essential for targeting transmembrane domains regardless of their position relative to the amino-terminus. By contrast, many proteins containing cleavable amino-terminal signal peptides were efficiently cotranslationally targeted in SRP's absence. We also reveal an unanticipated consequence of SRP loss: Transcripts normally targeted to the ER were mistargeted to mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial defects. These results elucidate SRP's essential roles in maintaining the efficiency and specificity of protein targeting. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of whole cell or streptavidin-purified ribosomes biotinylated by ER or mitochondrial localized biotin ligase in yeast"
PRJNA415722,Dynamic remodeling of translation programs drives hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration,"During liver regeneration, most new hepatocytes arise from pre-existing ones; yet, the underlying mechanisms that drive these cells from quiescence to proliferation remain poorly defined. By using high-resolution transcriptome profiling of polysome fractions from purified hepatocytes isolated from quiescent and toxin-injured adult mouse livers,we uncover the mRNA transcripts regulated during liver regeneration. The translational remodeling modulates protein levels of a set of splicing factors including Epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 (ESRP2), which activates an early postnatal splicing program in regenerating hepatocytes as well as metabolic genes. Overall design: Hepatocytes were isolated in presence of Cycloheximide (CHX) from normal fed mice and DDC fed (4 week) mice. Polysomal fractions were separated over sucrose gradient and RNA was isolated from the three fractions Monosome (1 ribosome), Light polysome (2-4 ribosomes) and Heavy polysomes (>5).  Isolated RNA was subject to polyA selection and sequenced on an Illumina platform."
PRJNA415390,N6-methyladenosine mRNA marking promotes selective translation of regulons required for human erythropoiesis[Ribosome Profiling],"Many of the regulatory features governing erythrocyte specification, maturation, and associated disorders remain enigmatic. To identify new regulators of erythropoiesis, we performed a functional genomic screen for genes affecting expression of the erythroid marker CD235a/GYPA. Among validating hits were genes coding for the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA methyltransferase (MTase) complex, including, METTL14, METTL3, and WTAP.  We found that m6A MTase activity promotes erythroid gene expression programs through selective translation of ~300 m6A marked mRNAs, including those coding for SETD histone methyltransferases, ribosomal components, and polyA RNA binding proteins, and novel genes. Remarkably, loss of m6A marks resulted in dramatic loss of H3K4me3 marks across key erythroid-specific KLF1 transcriptional targets (e.g., Heme biosynthesis genes). Further, each m6A MTase subunit and a subset of their mRNAs targets are required for human erythroid specification in primary bone-marrow derived progenitors. Thus, m6A mRNA marks promote the translation of a network of genes required for human erythropoiesis. Overall design: Contains three replicates of ribosome protected RNA samples and total input RNA from non-targeting control sgRNA HEL cells and WTAP sgRNA KO HEL cells"

Previous publications reported this helicase to associate with AU-rich elements and to specifically unwind G-quadruplex structures. Here, we performed Ribosome footprintin in triplicats of HEK293 wildtype cells and DHX36-KO-HEK293 cells to identify changes in ribosome occupancy on mRNAs upon presence or absence of this helicase. After sequencing and mapping to the human genome at nucleotide-resolution level we analysed the coverage of ribosomes on target mRNAs, identified in this study (see PAR-CLIP). Our analyses show that only minor changes upon DHX36 knockout can be observed. Overall design: Examination of ribosome footprints in HEK293 wildtype cells and DHX36-KO-HEK293 cells"
PRJNA414959,Translation control of the immune checkpoint in cancer and its therapeutic targeting,"Cancer cells develop mechanisms to escape immunosurveillance, among which modulating the expression of immune suppressive messenger RNAs is most well-documented. However, how this is molecularly achieved remains largely unresolved. Here, we develop an in vivo mouse model of liver cancer to study oncogene cooperation in immunosurveillance. We show that MYC overexpression (MYCTg) synergizes with KRASG12D to induce an aggressive liver tumor leading to metastasis formation and reduced mouse survival compared with KRASG12D alone. Genome-wide ribosomal footprinting of MYCTg;KRASG12 tumors compared with KRASG12D revealed potential alterations in translation of mRNAs, including programmed-death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Further analysis revealed that PD-L1 translation is repressed in KRASG12D tumors by functional, non-canonical upstream open reading frames in its 5' untranslated region, which is bypassed in MYCTg;KRASG12D tumors to evade immune attack. We show that this mechanism of PD-L1 translational upregulation was effectively targeted by a potent, clinical compound that inhibits eIF4E phosphorylation, eFT508, which reverses the aggressive and metastatic characteristics of MYCTg;KRASG12D tumors. Together, these studies reveal how immune-checkpoint proteins are manipulated by distinct oncogenes at the level of mRNA translation, which can be exploited for new immunotherapies. Overall design: To identify the transcripts specifically translated in primary liver tumors in MYC; KRAS(G12D) and KRAS(G12D) mice, we first carefully micro-dissected primary liver tumor nodules in MYC; KRAS(G12D) and KRAS(G12D) mice as well as wildtype (WT) controls. We sequenced total mRNAs (2 replicates each) and ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPFs) using ribosome profiling (2 replicates each) to generate genome-wide transcriptional and translational landscapes, respectively."
PRJNA414611,RNA G-quadruplexes mark repressive upstream open reading frames in human mRNAs,"Translational control is a key determinant of protein abundance, which in turns defines the physiology and pathology of human cells. Initiation of translation is highly regulated in eukaryotes and is considered as the rate-limiting step of protein synthesis. mRNA secondary structures in 5' untranslated region (UTR) and associated helicases have been characterised as key determinants of translation initiation. Nevertheless the transcriptome-wide contribution of non-canonical secondary structures, such as RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s), to the translation of human mRNAs remains largely unappreciated. Here we use a ribosome profiling strategy to investigate the translational landscape associated to rG4s-containing mRNAs and the contribution of two rG4s-specialised DExH-box helicases, DHX9 and DHX36, to translation initiation in human cells. We show that rG4-forming sequences in 5'-UTR is associated with decreased translation efficiency which correlate with an increased ribosome density within the 5'-UTRs. We found that rG4s contribute to the translation of upstream open reading frames, and as a consequence, thwart the translation of the associated protein coding sequences (CDS). Depletion of the DHX36 and DHX9 helicases demonstrated that the formation of the rG4 structural motif rather than its nucleotide sequence mediate translation initiation. Our findings unveil a role for non-canonical structures in defining alternative 5' starts for human mRNAs translation initiation. Overall design: 11 Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq matched samples; 1 iCLIP libraries containing two barcoded replicates"
PRJNA413990,Context-specific Regulation of Coupled Transcription-Translation Modules Predicts Pervasive Ribosome Specialization,"The ribosome is a defining structure of all cellular organisms and represents the uniquely biological process of translation. Although ribosomes are typically represented as molecular assembly lines that constitutively perform coded protein synthesis, translation is a system property that emerges from interactions among diverse types of cellular components, including different classes of RNAs, proteins, and amino acids. The prevailing view that all ribosomes within a cell are structurally identical and functionally equivalent was challenged long ago, and is becoming increasingly less tenable with modern experimental tools. Through analysis of environmental and gene regulatory influence networks of H. salinarum, E. coli, and S. cerevisiae, we have discovered a generalized pattern of extensive, environment-specific modularity and heterogeneity in translational subsystems across these representative organisms from each of the three domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya). Systems analysis of H. salinarum growth-associated changes in total mRNA abundance (RNA-seq), ribosome associated transcripts (ribosome profiling), and protein abundance (SWATH- MS proteomics) further support the hypothesis that ribosomes are less of a singular entity, and more of a mosaic patchwork. These data provide evidence that variability in translational subsystems might confer intrinsic regulation of protein synthesis by selectively translating subsets of the transcriptome. We discuss the implication of linked translation-transcription modules as a minimal set of molecules for steering physiological state transitions, as well as acting as a fundamental constraint on biological evolution."
PRJNA413138,tsRibo-Seq: An Approach to Zoom In into Translation of Single Transcripts,"Ribo-Seq (ribosome profiling) enables global assessment of translation efficiency, yields and fidelity. However, low-abundance transcripts receive little coverage and fall outside of the Ribo-Seq detection limit. We developed a new twist of the Ribo-Seq approach, termed transcript specific Ribo-Seq (tsRibo-Seq) to specifically detect lowly abundant messenger RNAs (mRNAs). This approach yields unprecedented depth in the coverage of individual low-abundance transcripts allowing identification of slow and fast translating regions with nucleotide resolution.

PRJNA412874,"Ssd1 and Gcn2 suppress global translational efficiency in replicatively aged yeast, while their activation in young cells extends lifespan","Using ribosome profiling, we find globally reduced translation efficiency during mitotic / replicative aging in budding yeast. Two mechanisms contribute to this: Firstly, the mRNA binding protein Ssd1 is induced during aging, sequestering mRNAs to P-bodies and stress granules that are abundant in old cells. Indeed, overexpression of Ssd1 reduced protein synthesis in young cells and extended lifespan, while loss of Ssd1 reduced the translational deficit of old cells and shortened lifespan. Secondly, the Gcn2 kinase is activated in old cells, phosphorylating and inactivating the translational initiation factor eIF2a. Accordingly, deletion of GCN2 reduced the translational defect of old cells. Furthermore, overexpressing an uncharged tRNA to fully activate Gcn2, or overexpression of its downstream mediator, Gcn4, extended replicative lifespan in a manner that was mostly dependent on autophagy without inhibiting the TOR pathway. As such, Ssd1 induction, activation of the integrated stress response or autophagy are favorable TOR-independent therapeutic targets for lifespan extension. Overall design: Examination of transcription and translational efficiency in replicative lifespan analysis with RNA-seq and Ribo-seq with 3 replicates at 3 different timepoints"

Overall design: Mice were anesthetized briefly with 1.5–2% isoflurane.  A heat-blunted nylon suture (6/0) was inserted into the right external carotid artery and advanced until it obstructed the MCA together with the ligation of the common carotid artery for 35 min.  Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF, bregma coordinates: 2-mm posterior, 5-mm lateral) was continuously recorded by transcranial laser Doppler flowmetry from the induction of ischemia until 30 min after reperfusion.  Surgery success was determined by monitoring regional cerebral blood flow (CBF, bregma coordinates: 2-mm posterior, 5-mm lateral) using transcranial laser Doppler flowmetry, and required a residual CBF <15%, followed by >80% recovery within 10 min of reperfusion.   Following MCAO, mice were placed in temperature-controlled recovery cages for 3, 6, 12 or 24 hrs to prevent post-surgery hypothermia and sacrificed.  Sham animals were similarly anestheized, arteries exposed for surgical time period without filament insertion.  Cortical tissues from ipsilateral or contralateral hemispheres of MCAO or sham animals were dissected for MNase digestion, monosome purificaton, large ribosomal subunit (P0) immunoprecipitaton, RPF (ribosome protected fragment) extraction and library construction.  Each set of biological replicates represent animals from a distinct day of surgery.  Complete protocol detailed in referenced publication."
PRJNA408071,The dual methyltransferase METTL13 targets N-terminus and Lys55 of eEF1A and regulates codon-specific translation rates,"Eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome and thereby plays a key role in protein synthesis. Human eEF1A is post-translationally methylated on several lysine residues as well as on the N-terminus and until recently the responsible methyltransferases were largely elusive. Using mass spectrometry based screens, gene targeted cells and in vitro enzymology we identify the human methyltransferase like proteins 13 (METTL13), which contains two distinct methyltransferase domains, as an enzyme catalyzing both dimethylation of Lys55 and trimethylation of the N-terminus of eEF1A. Moreover, through ribosome profiling we demonstrate that loss of METTL13 function alters translation dynamics and results in changed translation rate of specific codons. In line with the established descriptive nomenclature for this type of enzymes we suggest that METTL13 is redubbed eEF1A dual methyltransferase (eEF1A-DMT / EEF1ADMT). Overall design: ribosome profiling and poly(A) RNA sequencing of wildtype and MELL13-KO cells. Libraries were prepared as triplicates, except for wt ribosome profiling libraries that are duplicates only."
PRJNA407986,Analysis of the translational landscape of Arabidopsis mitochondria,"Messenger RNA translation is a complex process that is still poorly understood in eukaryotic organelles like mitochondria. Growing evidence indicate though that mitochondrial translation differs from its bacterial counterpart in many key aspects. In this analysis, we used the ribosome profiling technology to generate a genome-wide snapshot view of mitochondrial translation in Arabidopsis. We show that, unlike in humans, most Arabidopsis mitochondrial ribosomes footprints measure 27 and 28 bases. We also reveal that respiratory subunits encoding mRNAs show much higher ribosome association than other mitochondrial mRNAs, implying that they are translated to higher levels. Homogenous ribosome densities were generally detected within each respiratory complex except for complex V where higher ribosome coverage corroborate with higher needs in specific subunits. In complex I respiratory mutants, a slight reorganization of mitochondrial mRNAs ribosome association was detected involving an increase in ribosome densities on certain ribosomal protein encoding transcripts and a reduction in the translation of a few complex V mRNAs. Altogether, our observations reveal that plant mitochondrial translation is a dynamic process and that translational control is important for gene expression in plant mitochondria. This study paves the way for future advances in the understanding of translation in higher plant mitochondria. Overall design: In this study, 2 Arabidopsis mutants are compared to the wild type using duplicates for the Ribosome Profiling experiment. RNASEQ: was conducted to observe the editing rates of Col0 transcripts. RIBOSEQ: was conducted to observe the ribosome occupancy on each transcript of wild type and mutants."
PRJNA406823,"Transcriptome-wide profiling of poly(A)-tail length, translation efficiency and mRNA stability using TED-seq, mRNA-seq, Ribo-seq and PRO-seq in ER stress conditions","We report systematical profiling of translation efficiency and mRNA stability dependent on the dynamics of poly(A)-tail length in stress conditions of human cells. In this study, we developed a new feasible method measuring poly(A)-tail length called TED-seq and applied it to investigate the change of mRNA's poly(A)-tail lengths in ER stress pharmacologically induced by thapsigargin (THAP). Combined with other global RNA analyses such as RNA-seq, Ribo-seq and PRO-seq, we observed that ER stress induced lenthening poly(A)-tail length, in particular of ER-stress-regulators, upon ER stress. More specifically, these mRNAs are translationally de-repressed and more stabilized based on increase in poly(A)-tail length. We also identified that insoluble fractions which include stress-induced RNA-granules have overall shorter length of poly(A) tail. Taken together, our data suggest that poly(A)-tail lengths are dynamically regulated and influence both translation efficiency and mRNA stability in ER stress. Overall design: 1) TED-seq (5 replicates) in cytoplasm and RNA granule fractions (3 replicates) of DMSO- or THAP-treated HEK293 cells 2) RNA-seq (4 replicates), Ribo-seq (4 replicates) and PRO-seq (2 replicates) in whole cells with DMSO- or THAP-treated HEK293 cells"

PRJNA401882,Simultaneous and systematic analysis of cellular and viral gene expression during Enterovirus 71-induced host shutoff,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection causes a profound shutoff of cellular protein synthesis. Deep RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling were employed to systematically analyze messenger RNA and ribosome-protected RNA in EV71-infected rhabdomyosarcoma cells at progressive time points following infection. The analysis characterized the dynamic transcriptional and translational landscapes of both the virus and host cells. The results indicated that reduced translation of cellular mRNAs played a key role in EV71-induced host shutoff rather than mRNA depletion. During the host shutoff, EV71 protein was preferably synthesized through both a translational advantage and abundant mRNA production. Moreover, a small number of cellular genes were resistant to the host shutoff through both transcriptional and translational regulation, including genes in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway that is important for EV71 replication. These results indicated selective cellular protein synthesis during EV71-induced host shutoff as a mechanism the virus utilizes to benefit its replication. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq of RD cell infected with EV71 or mock, 3 time points, two triplicate in the last two time points, using Illumina Hiseq 2000."
PRJNA401857,A stress response that monitors and regulates mRNA structure is central to cold-shock adaptation,"Temperature influences the structural and functional properties of cellular components, necessitating stress responses to restore homeostasis following temperature shift. The heat shock circuitry is well understood, but that controlling the E. coli cold-shock adaptation program is not.  We found that during the growth arrest phase (acclimation) that follows shift to low temperature, protein synthesis increases and ORF-wide mRNA secondary structure decreases. We identified two components of an mRNA surveillance system that enable recovery of translation during acclimation: RNase R assures appropriate mRNA degradation and the Csps dynamically adjust mRNA secondary structure to globally modulate protein expression level. Csps also remodel their own mRNAs to tune their expression to cellular need. Thus, appropriate translation is dynamically adjusted with Csp control. The universality of Csps in bacteria suggests broad utilization of this control mechanism. Overall design: Ribosome profiling, total RNA/mRNA-seq and DMS-seq data at 37°C and following cold shock in E. coli Please note that the samples with _1 and _2 (in the sample titles) represent biological replicates of the same experiments."

PRJNA398585,Ternary protein•drug•RNA interface explains RocA sequence selectivity and Aglaia resistance,"A novel class of translation inhibitors isolated from Aglaia plants, exemplified by Rocaglamide A (RocA), shows promise as an anti-cancer therapy. RocA converts its molecular target, translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), a DEAD-box protein, into a purine-selective RNA-binding protein that represses protein synthesis from a subset of mRNAs. This unusual mechanism of action raises the question of how the drug induces selectivity for polypurine sequences. Furthermore, as eIF4A is found in all eukaryotes, it is unclear how Aglaia resists the effects of RocA. Here, we assembled the Aglaia transcriptome de novo and identified highly specific mutations in eIF4A that enable it to evade RocA-dependent translation inhibition. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structure of the human eIF4A1•ATP analog•RocA•polypurine RNA complex. RocA binds residues mutated in Aglaia and intercalates between consecutive purines at a sharp RNA bend, revealing the structural basis of polypurine-selective translational inhibition by RocA in human and resistance in Aglaia.

PRJNA398285,N6-Methyladenosine Guides mRNA Alternative Translation during Integrated Stress Response,"The integrated stress response (ISR) facilitates cellular adaptation to a variety of stress conditions via phosphorylation of the common target eIF2a. During ISR, the translation of certain stress-related mRNAs is upregulated in spite of global suppression of protein synthesis.The selective translation often relieson alternative mechanisms, such as leaky scanning or reinitiation, but the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here we report that,in response to amino acid starvation, the reinitiation of ATF4 is not only governed by eIF2a-controlled ternary complex availability, but is also subjected to regulation by mRNA methylation in the form of N6-methyladenosine (m6A). We demonstrate that m6A in the 5'' untranslated region (5' UTR) controls ribosome scanning and subsequent start codonselection. Global profiling of initiating ribosomes reveals widespread alternative translation events influenced by mRNA methylation. Consistently, Fto-transgenic mice manifest enhanced ATF4 expression, highlighting the critical role of 5' UTR methylation in translational regulation of ISR at cellular and organismal levels.

Keywords: ribosome profiling, translation, RiboLace, Ribo-Seq, active translation Overall design: We performed active ribosome profiling with RiboLace in brain extracts from a mouse (Smn+/-; SMN2tg/0). Experiments were performed in biological duplicate."
PRJNA397422,Nutritional control of protein translation,"Regulation of protein translation is a key feature of many biological processes. Global protein translation as well as translation at the codon level can be regulated by RNA modifications. These modifications are particularly enriched in tRNAs, where they represent an additional regulatory layer on top of the primary RNA sequence. In eukaryotes, levels of tRNA queuosinylation reflect the bioavailability of the precursor queuine, which is salvaged from the gut microbiota and absorbed in the intestine. We show here that reduced queuine supply results in a strong reduction of tRNA queuosinylation in various cultured human cell lines and mouse tissues. In addition, Dnmt2-dependent tRNA methylation is dynamically modulated by the presence or absence of queuine. Ribosome profiling showed that nutritionally determined queuosine-tRNA (Q-tRNA) levels control the translation speed of Q-tRNA decoded codons. Dysregulation of translation resulted in pronounced endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the unfolded protein response, which could be rescued by the addition of queuine. Together, these findings establish a direct link between nutrient availability and the decoding of the transcriptome, thus providing a new perspective in our understanding of translational regulation. Overall design: Cytoplasmic RNA and Cytoplasmic RNA protected by ribosome from RNase I (Ribonuclease I) cleavage, were sequenced. Small RNA libraries were performed according to the protocol using NEB NEXT Small RNA library Prep Set for Illumina (Multiplex Compatible) E7330, and size-selected (120-170 base pairs) before sequencing."

PRJNA397035,Ribosome profiling analysis of heat effect on rice,"To impose the heat treatment similar to the Structure-seq experiment, we applied Ribo-seq to 14-day-old rice (Oryza sativa) shoot tissue to investigate the effect of heat stress (42°C) as compared to control condition (22°C). Overall design: Two-week-old rice plants in pots were inverted and the shoots were immersed in a water bath at 22°C or 42°C for 10 min treatment, and ten shoots were harvested for each individual sample. Two biological replicates were obtained for each treatment and time-point. Ribosome profiling libraries were then made using these four sets of materials to determine the translational efficiency changes under different temperatures."
PRJNA396698,Acetylation of cytidine in messenger RNA,"Generation of the epitranscriptome through post-transcriptional ribonucleoside modification embeds a layer of regulatory complexity into RNA structure and function. Here we describe N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) as an mRNA modification that is catalyzed by the acetyltransferase NAT10. Transcriptome-wide mapping of ac4C revealed discretely acetylated regions that were enriched within coding sequences. Ablation of NAT10 reduced ac4C detection at the mapped mRNA sites and was globally associated with target mRNA down-regulation. Analysis of mRNA half-lives revealed a NAT10-dependent increase in stability in the cohort of acetylated mRNAs. mRNA acetylation was further demonstrated to enhance substrate translation in vitro and in vivo. Codon content analysis within ac4C peaks uncovered a biased representation of cytidine within wobble sites that was empirically determined to influence mRNA decoding efficiency. These findings expand the repertoire of mRNA modifications to include an acetylated residue and establish a role for ac4C in the regulation of mRNA translation. Generation of the “epitranscriptome” through post-transcriptional ribonucleoside modification embeds a layer of regulatory complexity into RNA structure and function. Here we describe N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) as a novel mRNA modification that is catalyzed by the acetyltransferase NAT10. Transcriptome-wide mapping of ac4C revealed discretely acetylated regions that were distributed across target mRNAs with the majority of peaks occurring within coding regions. Depletion of ac4C through NAT10 ablation revealed a relationship to gene expression wherein loss of ac4C was globally associated with transcript downregulation. The presence of ac4C within coding sequences was associated with elevated ribosome density and enhanced translation, as assessed in vivo and in vitro. In addition to expanding the repertoire of mRNA modifications to include an acetylated residue, these findings highlight a role for ac4C in the control of mRNA metabolism at the level of translation. Overall design: Detection of acetylated cytide in RNA with immunoprecipitation (RIP), along with RNA-Seq, Ribo-Seq, and BRIC-Seq to analyze effects on RNA processing and stability."
PRJNA396456,Base-resolution mapping reveals distinct classes of N1-methyladenosine methylome in nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded transcripts,"Gene expression can be post-transcriptionally regulated via dynamic and reversible RNA modifications. N1-methyladenosine (m1A) is a recently identified mRNA modification; however, little is known about its precise location, regulation and function. Here, we develop a single-nucleotide resolution m1A profiling method, based on m1A-induced misincorporation during reverse transcription, and report distinct classes of m1A methylome in the human transcriptome. m1A in the 5'-untranslated region, particularly those located exactly at the first nucleotide of mRNA transcripts, associates with increased translation efficiency. A different subset of m1A sites exhibit a GUUCRA tRNA-like motif, are evenly distributed in the transcriptome and are dependent on the methyltransferase complex TRMT6/61A. Additionally, we show for the first time that m1A is prevalent in the mitochondrial-encoded transcripts. Manipulation of m1A level via TRMT61B, a mitochondria-localizing m1A methyltransferase, demonstrates that m1A in mitochondrial mRNA interferes with translation. Collectively, our approaches reveal distinct classes of m1A methylome and provide a resource for functional studies of m1A-mediated epitranscriptomic regulation. Overall design: We developed a method named m1A-MAP to detect m1A in both the nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial encoded  transcriptome in a single-base resolution. We first tested several available RTases (including AMV, SuperScript II, SuperScript III and TGIRT) under different conditions for their performance on capturing m1A-induced reverse transcription signature (RT1-RT10). Then we applied our methods to detect m1A sites in the human transcriptome (m1A_input_TGIRT,m1A_IP_TGIRT, m1A_IP_demethylase_TGIRT, two replicates for each sample) . We also perform m1A seq for RNA fractions below 200nt in TRMT6/61 KD cells to evaluate the substrat specifity of m1A sites in tRNA (Mock and TRMT6_61A). Lastly, we investigated the correlation between m1A-mRNAs and their translation efficiency by performing ribosome profiling (HEK293T_RNA-seq and HEK293_Ribo-seq). Please note that these data were produced from the X-ten sequencing platform, and the output raw data were pair-end. However, due to the particularity of our library construction (a random barcode of 10 nt were included in our 3'' end cDNA adapter, which cannot be precisely located in Read 1), data of Read 1 were discarded and only the data of Read 2 were used in our analysis and, therefore, submitted as single-end files."

PRJNA395723,Scope and mechanism of eIF4F-independent mRNA translation,"In eukaryotic cells, protein synthesis typically begins with the binding of eIF4F to the 7-methylguanylate (m7G)cap found on the 5' end of the majority of mRNAs. Surprisingly, overall translational output remains robust under eIF4F inhibition. The sustained protein synthesis has been largely attributed to cap-independent translation mediated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). However, the IRES-driven translation is substrate-specific and largely incompatible with the broad spectrum of eIF4F-resistant translatomes.Here, we report that N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-mediated translation prevails on capped mRNAs and is resistant to eIF4F inactivation.Depletion of the methyltransferase METTL3 selectively inhibits translation of mRNAs bearing 5'UTR methylation, but not mRNAs with 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) elements. Mechanistically, we identify ABCF1 as a critical mediator of m6A-promoted translation under both stress and physiological conditions. Supporting the role of ABCF1 in m6A-mediated cap-independent translation, ABCF1-sensitive transcripts largely overlap with METTL3-responsible mRNA targets. By illustrating the scope and the mechanism of translation initiation that is neither cap- nor IRES-dependent, these findingsreshape our current perceptions of cellular translational pathways Overall design: Ribo-seq and RNA-seq in Scramble, ABCF1 and METTL3 knockdown."
PRJNA395590,Cell type-specific translation profiling reveals a novel strategy for treating fragile X syndrome,"Excessive mRNA translation downstream of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu1/5) is a core pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome (FX), however the differentially translating mRNAs that contribute to altered neural function are not known. We used Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq to identify mistranslating mRNAs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y) hippocampus, which exhibit exaggerated mGlu1/5-induced long-term synaptic depression (LTD). In these neurons, we find the Chrm4 transcript encoding muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4) is excessively translated, and synthesis of M4 downstream of mGlu5 activation is mimicked and occluded. Surprisingly, enhancement rather than inhibition of M4 activity normalizes core phenotypes in the Fmr1-/y, including excessive protein synthesis, exaggerated mGluR-LTD, and audiogenic seizures. These results suggest that not all excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1-/y brain are detrimental, and some may be candidates for enhancement to correct pathological changes in the FX brain. Overall design: 6 biological replicates of total hippocampal mRNA (Input) from WT and Fmr1 KO littermate pairs and CA1-TRAP-IP (IP) from the same 6 WT and KO littermate pairs."

PRJNA393189,SLAM-seq defines direct gene-regulatory functions of the BRD4-MYC axis [SLAM-seq],"Defining direct targets of transcription factors and regulatory pathways is key to understanding their role in physiology and disease. Here we combine SLAM-seq, a novel method for direct quantification of newly synthesized mRNAs, with pharmacological and rapid chemical-genetic perturbation to interrogate primary transcriptional targets of BRD4 and MYC and define the response to BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi). While BRD4 acts as a global co-activator of Pol2-dependent transcription in a BET bromodomain-dependent manner, therapeutic BETi doses deregulate a small set of hypersensitive target genes. In contrast to BRD4, MYC primarily acts as a selective transcriptional activator that controls basic metabolic processes such as ribosome biogenesis and de-novo purine synthesis across diverse cancer contexts. Beyond defining primary regulatory functions of BRD4 and MYC in cancer, our study establishes a simple, robust and scalable approach to dissect direct transcriptional targets of any gene or pathway.

PRJNA392312,Transcriptome-wide analysis of roles for tRNA modifications in translational regulation,"Covalent nucleotide modifications in noncoding RNAs such as tRNAs affect a plethora of biological processes, with new functions continuing to be discovered for even well-known tRNA modifications. To systematically compare the functions of a large set of ncRNA modifications in gene regulation, we carried out ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq in budding yeast for 57 nonessential genes involved in tRNA modification. Overall design: Yeast strains were treated with cycloheximide and proceeded to ribosome profiling. For ribosome-protected footprints (RPF), 80S monosome fractions were isolated after RNase I treatment, and 27-34 nt RPF were isolated by denaturing PAGE. For RNA-Seq, total RNA was depleted of rRNA using Ribo-Zero, followed by zinc-based fragmentation. RNA fragments and RPF are constructed into Illumina deep-sequencing libraries by RNA 3' adaptor ligation and cDNA circularization. Barcoded libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500. Raw fastq reads were de-multiplexed and removed of adaptor sequence. RPF reads were mapped to S. cerevisiae rDNA and the mapping reads were discarded. The remaining RPF reads and RNA-seq reads were mapped to sacCer3 genome. Uniquely mapping reads in length of 27-34 nt (RPF) or 27 nt (RNA-seq) were quantified as RPKM."

PRJNA391480,The RNA-binding protein Hfq is important for ribosome biogenesis and affects translation fidelity,"Ribosome biogenesis is a complex and intricate process involving multiple factors. A plethora of auxiliary proteins assist the correct assembly of rRNA and ribosomal proteins into mature ribosomes. Defects in this process cause dysfunctional ribosomes which may alter protein synthesis and impair cell fitness. Despite its importance, yet we are lacking mechanistic details of ribosome biogenesis. Here we show that the widely-conserved RNA chaperone Hfq, which is an important post-transcriptional regulator in sRNA-mRNA basepairing in Escherichia coli, plays a critical role in rRNA processing and consequently ribosome assembly. Hfq binds the 17S rRNA precursor and facilitates its correct processing and folding to mature 16S rRNA. Strikingly, Hfq depletion decreases the pool of mature 70S ribosomes. Mutations in residues located in the distal face of Hfq render reduced ribosome levels in contrast to mutations in the proximal and rim surfaces which govern interactions with the sRNAs. Our results indicate that the described Hfq-dependent regulation of ribosomes is independent of its function as sRNA-regulator. Furthermore, we observed that inactivation of Hfq compromises translation efficiency and fidelity, both features of aberrantly assembled ribosomes. Our work expands the functions of Hfq beyond its function in small RNA-mediated regulation and unveil a novel role of Hfq as crucial auxiliary factor in ribosome biogenesis and translation.

PRJNA391262,Rapid recovery gene downregulation during excess-light stress and recovery in Arabidopsis,"Stress recovery may prove to be a promising approach to increase plant performance, and theoretically, mRNA instability may facilitate faster recovery. Transcriptome (RNA-seq, qPCR, sRNA-seq, PARE) and methylome profiling during repeated excess-light stress and recovery was performed at intervals as short as three minutes. We demonstrate that 87% of the stress-upregulated mRNAs analysed exhibit very rapid recovery. For instance, HSP101 abundance declined two-fold every 5.1 minutes. We term this phenomenon Rapid Recovery Gene Downregulation (RRGD), whereby mRNA abundance rapidly decreases promoting transcriptome resetting. Decay constants (k) were modelled using two strategies, linear and non-linear least squares regressions, with the latter accounting for both transcription and degradation. This revealed extremely short half-lives ranging from 2.7-60.0 minutes for 222 genes. Ribosome footprinting using degradome data demonstrated RRGD loci undergo co-translational decay and identified changes in the ribosome stalling index during stress and recovery. However, small RNAs and 5'-3' RNA decay were not essential for recovery of the transcripts examined, nor were any of the six excess light-associated methylome changes. We observed recovery-specific gene expression networks upon return to favorable conditions and six transcriptional memory types. In summary, rapid transcriptome resetting is reported in the context of active recovery and cellular memory."
PRJNA391171,RNA editing by ADAR1 leads to context-dependent transcriptome-wide changes in RNA Secondary Structure,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is the master RNA editor, catalyzing the deamination of adenosine to inosine. RNA editing is vital for  preventing abnormal activation of cytosolic nucleic acid sensing pathways by self-double-stranded RNAs. Here we determine by parallel analysis of RNA secondary structure sequencing (PARS-seq), the global RNA secondary structure changes in ADAR1 deficient cells. Surprisingly, ADAR1 silencing resulted in a lower global double-stranded to single-stranded RNA ratio, suggesting that A-to-I editing can stabilize a large subset of imperfect RNA duplexes. The duplexes destabilized by editing are composed of vastly complementary inverted Alus found in untranslated regions of genes with vital biological processes, including housekeeping functions and type-I interferon responses. They are predominantly cytoplasmic and generally demonstrate higher ribosomal occupancy. Our findings imply that the editing effect on RNA secondary structure is context dependent and underline the intricate regulatory role of ADAR1 on global RNA secondary structure. Overall design: Examination of control and ADAR1 KD HepG2 cells using PARSseq method in order to find changes in RNA 2D structure induced by A-to-I RNA editing. We used PARSseq for HepG2 control and ADAR KD cells in two replicates with S1/V1 nucleases treatment for each ((control+KD)*2*2= 8 PARSseq samples). We used RNAseq of HepG2 control and ADAR KD cells with additional Ribo-seq (control and ADAR KD in 2 replicates=4 Ribo-seq samples) to further confirm the changes we observed in the PARSseq experiment."
PRJNA390134,Transcriptional and ribosome profiling of Drosophila 3rd instar larvae muscle,"Presynaptic efficacy can be modulated by retrograde control mechanisms, but the nature of these complex signaling systems remain obscure. Some studies have suggested that retrograde synaptic communication requires new protein synthesis in the postsynaptic compartment, yet the putative translational targets that mediate this signaling are enigmatic. To gain insight into the retrograde mechanisms that stabilize synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction, we have developed and optimized a tissue-specific ribosome profiling approach in Drosophila. We first demonstrate the ability of this technology to define genome-wide translational regulations that could not be inferred from transcription, and validate the superior sensitivity of ribosome profiling over conventional translational profiling. We then leverage this technology to test the relative contributions of transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms in the postsynaptic muscle that orchestrate the retrograde control of presynaptic function. Surprisingly, we find no changes in transcription or translation are necessary to enable retrograde homeostatic signaling. Rather, post-translational mechanisms appear to ultimately gate instructive retrograde communication. Finally, we find that a global increase in translation induces adaptive responses in both transcription and translation of protein chaperones and degradation factors to promote cellular proteostasis. Together, this demonstrates the power of ribosome profiling to define transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms driving retrograde signaling during adaptive plasticity. Overall design: Transcriptional (RNA-seq of total RNA) and ribosome profiling were performed in Drosophila muscle tissue. Three genotypes were analyzed: wild type (control sample), GluRIIA mutant and Tor muscle overexpression. In addition, translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) based translational profiling was done in wild type sample to assay the difference between ribosome profiling and TRAP translational profiling. Three replicates were performed for each analysis."

PRJNA388385,Comparative ribosome profiling uncovers a dominant role for translational control in Toxoplasma gondii,"The lytic cycle of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which involves a brief sojourn in the extracellular space, is characterized by defined transcriptional profiles. For an obligate intracellular parasite that is shielded from the cytosolic host immune factors by a parasitophorous vacuole, the brief entry into the extracellular space is likely to exert enormous stress. Due to its role in cellular stress response, we hypothesize that translational control plays an important role in regulating gene expression in Toxoplasma during the lytic cycle. Unlike transcriptional profiles, insights into genome-wide translational profiles of Toxoplasma gondii are lacking. We have performed genome-wide ribosome profiling, coupled with high throughput RNA sequencing, in intracellular and extracellular Toxoplasma gondii parasites to investigate translational control during the lytic cycle. Results: Although differences in transcript abundance were mostly mirrored at the translational level, we observed significant differences in the abundance of ribosome footprints between the two parasite stages. Furthermore, our data suggest that mRNA translation in the parasite is potentially regulated by mRNA secondary structure and upstream open reading frames. Overall design: We compared ribosome footprints in intracellular and extracellular parasites."
PRJNA386877,Regulated Ire1-dependent mRNA decay requires no-go mRNA degradation to maintain endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis in S. pombe,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) continually monitors the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In S. pombe, Ire1, an ER membrane-resident kinase/endoribonuclease, utilizes a mechanism of selective degradation of ER-targeted mRNAs (RIDD) to maintain ER homeostasis. Here, we used a genetic screen to identify factors critical to the Ire1-mediated UPR response in S. pombe and found several proteins, Dom34, Hbs1 and SkiX, previously implicated in ribosome rescue and the no-go-decay (NGD) pathway. Ribosome profiling in ER-stressed cells lacking these factors revealed that Ire1-mediated cleavage on ER-associated mRNAs results in ribosome stalling on the cleaved transcript and, ultimately in full mRNA degradation.  The process engages mechanisms of precise, iterated cleavage of the mRNAs and ribosome rescue. This clear signature allowed us to discover hundreds of novel mRNA targets of Ire1. Our results reveal that the UPR in S. pombe executes RIDD in an intricate interplay between Ire1, translation, and the NGD surveillance pathway, and establish a critical role for NGD in maintaining ER homeostasis. Overall design: 16 samples are included in the study (8 mRNA-Seq samples and 8 ribosome footprinting samples). Read sizes were examined for lengths of 15-18 nt and 25-34 nt for all profiling samples and reads were aligned by 5' ends for mRNA-Seq and 3' ends for profiling."

The ribosome pellet obtained was then dissolved in TRIzol for RNA extraction. RNA obtained was then run on 15% urea-PAGE for 2h at 200V. Bands between 34-25 nt were cut, and RNA was eluted out from the gel using 0.3M NaCl.

Beside total Ribosome Protected Fragments (RPFs), RPFs from mRNAs protected by immature pre-40S pre-ribosomes was also analysed. The analysis showed that immature 40S ribosomes can carry out translation and their premature entry into translation is hindered by Rio1p. Overall design: mRNAs fragments protected by ribosomes were subjected to NGS Ribosome Profiling experiment. Samples included (1) total ribosome-associated mRNAs from yeast cells expressing Rio1p, (2) total ribosome-associated mRNAs from yeast cells depleted of Rio1p and (3) immuno-selected mRNAs associated with immature pre-40S pre-ribosomal particles from yeast-cells depleted of Rio1p.

PRJNA382718,Translation initiation from conserved non-AUG codons provides additional layers of regulation and coding capacity,"Neurospora crassa cpc-1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCN4 are homologs specifying transcription activators that drive the transcriptional response to amino acid limitation. The cpc-1 mRNA contains two upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its >700 nt 5’-leader and its expression is controlled at the level of translation in response to amino acid starvation. We used N. crassa cell-free extracts and obtained data indicating that cpc-1 uORF1 and uORF2 are functionally analogous to GCN4 uORF1 and uORF4 in controlling translation. We also found that the 5’ region upstream of the main coding sequence of the cpc-1 mRNA extends for more than 700 nucleotides without any in-frame stop codon. For 100 cpc-1 homologs from Pezizomycotina and from selected Basidiomycota, 5’ conserved extensions of the CPC1 reading frame are also observed. Multiple non-AUG near-cognate codons (NCCs) in the CPC1 reading frame upstream of uORF2, some deeply conserved, could potentially initiate translation. At least four NCCs initiated translation in vitro. In vivo data were consistent with initiation at NCCs to produce N-terminally extended N. crassa CPC1 isoforms. The pivotal role played by CPC1, combined with its translational regulation by uORFs and NCC utilization, underscore the emerging significance of non-canonical initiation events in controlling gene expression.

PRJNA382534,Ribosome pausing at the AT-rich codons regulates the protein expression of secondary metabolite gene clusters in the Streptomyces tsukubaensis NRRL 18488,"Streptomyces tsukubaensis NRRL 18488 is the preferred strain for the production of immunosuppressant agent tacrolimus (FK506). To take full advantage of its genetic potential, systematic understanding of secondary metabolism and related regulatory mechanisms is highly demanded. Here, to this end, we complete its 7.9 Mbp linear genome sequence followed by integrating with multi-omics measurements. With accurate reannotation of FK506 gene cluster, total 2,389 transcription start sites were determined by using primary transcriptome analysis. Integrated analysis of transcriptome and translatome data revealed that secondary metabolic gene clusters, especially FK506 cluster, undergo translational control with decrease in translational efficiency according to the growth. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SD motif has little correlation with ribosome pausing but AT-rich codons delay the translational elongation. Strong ribosome pausing was observed in the rare TTA codon in FK506 cluster.

PRJNA381914,TRAP sequencing of D1 and D2 spiny projection neurons from young and old mice and ribosome profiling in NIH-3T3 cells,"Particular brain regions and cell populations exhibit increased susceptibility to aging-related stresses. Here, we describe the age-specific and brain-region-specific accumulation of ribosome-associated 3' UTR RNAs that lack the 5' UTR and open reading frame. Our study reveals this phenomenon impacts hundreds of genes in aged D1 spiny projection neurons of the mouse striatum and also occurs in the aging human brain. Isolated 3' UTR accumulation is tightly correlated with mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative stress, with full-length mRNA expression that is reduced but not eliminated and with production of short 3' UTR-encoded peptides. Depletion of the oxidation-sensitive Fe-S cluster ribosome recycling factor ABCE1 induces the accumulation of 3' UTRs, consistent with a model in which ribosome stalling and mRNA cleavage by No-Go decay yields isolated 3' UTR RNAs protected by ribosomes. Isolated 3' UTR accumulation is a hallmark of brain aging, likely reflecting regional differences in metabolism and oxidative stress. Overall design: sequencing of TRAP isolated cell-type specific mRNA from D1 and D2 spiny projection neurons in aged and young mice. 4 Biological replicates per condition. Additional experiments from ribosome profiling of NIH-3T3 cells treated with paraquat, siRNAs to ABCE1 and a control siRNA"
PRJNA381596,mTORC1 balances cellular amino acid supply with demand for protein synthesis through post-transcriptional control of ATF4,"The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of cell growth that is commonly deregulated in human diseases. Here we find that mTORC1 controls a transcriptional program encoding amino acid transporters and metabolic enzymes through a mechanism also used to regulate protein synthesis. Bioinformatic analysis of mTORC1-responsive mRNAs identified a promoter element recognized by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a key effector of the integrated stress response. ATF4 translation is normally induced by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2a) through a mechanism that requires upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the ATF4 5'' UTR. mTORC1 also controls ATF4 translation through uORFs, but independent of changes in eIF2a phosphorylation. mTORC1 instead employs the 4E-binding protein (4E-BP) family of translation repressors. These results link mTORC1-regulated demand for protein synthesis with an ATF4-regulated transcriptional program that controls the supply of amino acids to the translation machinery. Overall design: RNA-seq analysis of wild-type and ATF4-null HEK293T cells treated with Torin 1 or tunicamycin for 6 h, and ribosome profiling analysis of HEK293T cells treated with Torin 1 for 24 h."

PRJNA380795,Methylation of human eukaryotic elongation factor alpha (eEF1A) by a member of a novel protein lysine methyltransferase family modulates mRNA translation,"Many cellular proteins are post-translationally modified by methylation of lysine residues. This has been most intensively studied in the case of histone proteins, where lysine methylations in the flexible tails are determinants of chromatin state and gene expression. Lysine methylations on non-histone proteins are also frequent, but in most cases the functional significance of the methylation event, as well as the identity of the responsible lysine (K) specific methyltransferase (KMT), remain unknown. While the majority of identified human KMTs belong to the SET (Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, Trithorax)-domain class of methyltransferases (MTases), several recently discovered KMTs belong to a different MTase class, the seven-beta-strand (7BS) MTases. Here, we have investigated an uncharacterized human 7BS MTase currently annotated as being part of the endothelin converting enzyme 2 (ECE2). However, transcriptomics data indicate that this MTase is not part of ECE2, and should be considered a separate protein. Combining in vitro enzymology and analyses of knockout cells, we demonstrate that this MTase efficiently methylates K36 in eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that this novel KMT is named eEF1A-KMT4 (gene name EEF1AKMT4), in agreement with the recently established nomenclature. Furthermore, by ribosome profiling we show that the absence of K36 methylation affects translation dynamics and changes translation speed of distinct codons. Finally, we demonstrate that eEF1A-KMT4 is part of a novel family of human KMTs, defined by a shared sequence motif in the active site, and we show the importance of this motif for catalytic activity. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNAseq data for wt and  EEF1AKMT4 knockout cells. This study includes the re-use of samples GSM2445294 and GSM2445295 from GSE93133. These two samples have been re-accessioned here so that the complete study is available from the SRP ID."

Multiple strains of the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginos can survive on normal alkanes as a sole carbon source. The environmental P. aeruginosa strain ATCC 33988, isolated from a fuel storage tank, consumes n-alkanes much more efficiently than the clinical lab isolate PAO1. We combine multiple –omics techniques to elucidate gene expression pattern differences between these two closely-related P. aeruginosa strains."

PRJNA378770,ZFP36 RNA binding proteins restrain T-cell activation and anti-viral immunity [HITS-CLIP],"Dynamic post-transcriptional control of RNA expression by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is critical during immune response. ZFP36 RBPs are prominent inflammatory regulators linked to autoimmunity and cancer, but functions in adaptive immunity are less clear. We used HITS-CLIP to define ZFP36 targets in T-cells, which confirmed regulation of cytokine expression and revealed unanticipated actions in regulating T-cell activation and proliferation. Transcriptome and ribosome profiling showed that ZFP36 represses mRNA target abundance and translation, most robustly through a novel class of AU-rich sites in coding sequence. Functional studies revealed that ZFP36 regulates early T-cell activation kinetics by attenuating activation marker expression, limiting T-cell expansion, and promoting apoptosis in a cell autonomous manner. Strikingly, loss of ZFP36 in vivo accelerated T-cell responses to acute viral infection, and enhanced anti-viral immunity. These findings uncover a critical role for ZFP36 RBPs in restraining T-cell expansion and effector functions, and suggest ZFP36 inhibition as a novel strategy to enhance immune-based therapies.

After 4 hours, cells were harvested in the presence of cycloheximide and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cytoplasmic lysates were prepared and treated with micrococcal nuclease, then monosomes were isolated by sucrose gradient fractionation as described in the accompanying protocol  Ribosome-protected-fragments (RPFs) were released from monosomes, and ligated to a pre-adenylated 3? linker (GTGTCAGTCACTTCCAGCGG), then amplified using the Br-dU incorporation, cDNA circularization, and PCR strategy described in detail in the accompanying publication.  RT primers were designed to incorporate sample indices for multiplexing (trimmed from uploaded sequences) and a 7 nucleotide degenerate sequence (NNNNNNN; present in uploaded reads) at the 5? end of the sequenced read. Amplified libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Miseq, with 75 nucleotide single-end reads.

PRJNA377088,Global mRNA polarization regulates translation efficiency in the intestinal epithelium [Ribo-Seq],"Asymmetric mRNA localization facilitates efficient translation in cells such as neurons and fibroblasts. However, the extent and significance of mRNA polarization in epithelial tissues is unclear. Here, we used single molecule transcript imaging and subcellular transcriptomics to uncover global apical-basal intracellular polarization of mRNA in the mouse intestinal epithelium. The localization of mRNAs did not generally overlap protein localization. Instead, ribosomes were more abundant on the apical sides, and apical transcripts were consequently more efficiently translated. Refeeding of fasted mice elicited a basal to apical shift in polarization of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, which was associated with a specific boost in their translation. This lead to increased protein production, required for efficient nutrient absorption. These findings reveal a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism involving dynamic polarization of mRNA and polarized translation. Overall design: RNAseq and RiboSeq of the murine duodenum."
PRJNA376454,Gene expression profiling of inputs to the mesolimbic dopamine circuit,"PRV-Circuit-TRAP of DAT-cre mice injected with PRV-Introvert-GFP in the nucleus accumbens These studies identify important inputs to the mesolimbic dopamine pathway and further show that PRV circuit-directed translating ribosome affinity purification (PRV-Circuit-TRAP) can be broadly applied to identify molecularly defined neurons comprising complex, multisynaptic circuits. Overall design: The current study combined neuroanatomical tracing and molecular profiling of inputs to the mesolimbic dopamine pathway using pseudorabies virus whose replication and exression of GFP are dependent on Cre recombinase (PRV-Introvert-GFP).  To molecularly profile this circuit, we mated DAT-Cre to SYN-NBL10 mice and injected PRV-Introvert-GFP into the NAc. GFP expressed from PRV-Introvert-GFP binds to the NBL10-tagged polysomes and is then precipitated using anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitated RNA was purified (IP RNA) along with total RNA collected before immunoprecipitation (Input RNA) was purified and sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. The differential expression of transcripts in our IP fraction was calculated. Final values for fold enrichment were weighted for the effects of PRV infection on transcript abundance."
PRJNA376419,Evolutionary Convergence of Pathway-specific Enzyme Expression Stoichiometry,"Coexpression of proteins in response to pathway-inducing signals is the founding paradigm of gene regulation. Yet, it remains unexplored whether the relative abundance of coregulated proteins requires precise tuning. Here we present large-scale analyses of protein stoichiometry and corresponding regulatory strategies for 21 pathways and 67-224 operons in divergent bacteria separated by 0.6-2 billion years. Using end-enriched RNA-sequencing (Rend-seq) with single-nucleotide resolution, we found that many bacterial gene clusters encoding conserved pathways have undergone massive divergence in transcript abundance and architectures via remodeling of internal promoters and terminators. Remarkably, these evolutionary changes are compensated post-transcriptionally to maintain preferred stoichiometry of protein synthesis rates. Even more strikingly, in eukaryotic budding yeast, functionally analogous proteins that arose independently from bacterial counterparts also evolved to convergent in-pathway expression. The broad requirement for exact protein stoichiometries despite regulatory divergence provides an unexpected principle for building biological pathways both in nature and for synthetic activities. Overall design: Three ribosome profiling datasets (two in Bacillus subtilis and one in Vibrio natriegens). Eighteen Rend-seq data sets (Esherichia coli,  Bacillus subtilis, Vibrio natriegens, and Caulobacter crescentus, including mutants and different library preparations)."
PRJNA375739,"Differentiation of ncRNAs from small mRNAs in Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933 (EHEC) by combined RNAseq and RIBOseq – ryhB encodes the regulatory RNA RyhB and a peptide, RyhP","While NGS allows rapid global detection of transcripts, it remains difficult to distinguish ncRNAs from short mRNAs. To detect potentially translated RNAs, we developed an improved protocol for bacterial ribosomal footprinting (RIBOseq). This allowed distinguishing ncRNA from mRNA in EHEC. A high ratio of ribosomal footprints per transcript (ribosomal coverage value, RCV) is expected to indicate a translated RNA, while a low RCV should point to a non-translated RNA. Based on their low RCV, 150 novel non-translated EHEC transcripts were identified as putative ncRNAs, representing both antisense and intergenic transcripts, 74 of which had expressed homologs in E. coli MG1655. Bioinformatics analysis predicted statistically significant target regulons for 15 of the intergenic transcripts; experimental analysis revealed 4-fold or higher differential expression of 46 novel ncRNA in different growth media. Out of 329 annotated EHEC ncRNAs, 52 showed an RCV similar to protein-coding genes, of those, 16 had RIBOseq patterns matching annotated genes in other enterobacteriaceae, and 11 seem to possess a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, suggesting that such ncRNAs may encode small proteins instead of being solely non-coding. To support that the RIBOseq signals are reflecting translation, we tested the ribosomal-footprint covered ORF of ryhB and found a phenotype for the encoded peptide in iron-limiting condition. Determination of the RCV is a useful approach for a rapid first-step differentiation between bacterial ncRNAs and small mRNAs. Further, many known ncRNAs may encode proteins as well. Overall design: Comparison of RNAseq with RIBOseq data from EHEC grown in LB medium"
PRJNA375080,A spatio-temporal translatome of mouse tissue development,"Functional specification of mammalian tissues is a result of precise regulation of gene expression during development. Although previous transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have provided great biological insight into tissue specific gene expression and their physiological relevance in development, our understanding of translational regulation in developing tissues is lacking. Here, we report a spatio-temporally resolved translatome analysis of six mouse tissues at embryonic and adult stages to quantify the effects of translational regulation and identify new translational components. We quantified the spatial and temporal divergence of gene expression and showed specific changes in gene expression and pathways underlying the divergence. We further showed dynamic translational control by modulating translational efficiency, enhancing tissue specificity during development. We discovered thousands of actively translated upstream open read frames (ORFs) that exhibited spatio-temporal patterns and demonstrated their regulatory roles in translational regulation. Finally, we identified known and novel micropeptides encoded by small ORFs from long non-coding RNAs with functional relevance to tissue development. Our data and analyses facilitate a better understanding of complex translational regulation across tissue and developmental spectra and serve as a useful resource of mouse translatome. Overall design: Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed for six embryo tissues and six adult tissues separately from wild-type C57BL/6 mice at embryonic day (E) 15.5 and postnatal day (P) 42, including ectoderm-derived brain and retina, mesoderm-derived heart and kidney, as well as endoderm-derived liver and lung. For each tissue, two biological replicates were performed."
PRJNA374537,Inhibiting the oncogenic translation program is an effective therapeutic strategy in multiple myeloma,"Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a frequently incurable hematological cancer in which over activity of MYC plays a central role, notably through upregulation of ribosome biogenesis and translation. To better understand the oncogenic program driven by MYC and investigate its potential as a therapeutic target, we screened a chemically diverse small molecule library for anti-MM activity. The most potent hits identified were rocaglate-scaffold inhibitors of translation initiation. Expression profiling of MM cells revealed reversion of the oncogenic MYC-driven transcriptional program by CMLD010509, our most promising rocaglate. Proteome-wide, reversion correlated with selective depletion of short-lived proteins key to MM growth and survival, most notably MYC, MDM2, CCND1, MAF and MCL-1. The efficacy of CMLD010509 in mouse models of MM confirmed the therapeutic relevance of these findings in vivo and supports the feasibility of targeting the oncogenic MYC-driven translation program in MM with rocaglates. Overall design: RNA sequencing of 5 cell lines (NCI-H929, NAMALWA, U266, MM1S and OPM2) treated with CMLD010509 or vehicle control (DMSO)"
PRJNA371839,Kinetics of RNA polymerase 2 recruitment and H3K36me3 deposition after stimulation of murine T-cells,"Activation of immune cells results in extremely rapid functional changes, yet it remains enigmatic how this is accomplished. By combining time-courses of RNA-polymerase-II (RNAPII) Chip-Seq, 4sU-Seq, RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling during Th1 activation we provide a genome-wide view on temporal dynamics for ~10.000 genes. Gene responses vary in time and magnitude and allow the identification of unknown immediate early (IEG) and posttranscriptionally regulated genes. However, >90% are regulated transcriptionally with coupled changes in translation. Surprisingly, not poised, but rather re-positioned RNAPII correlates with transcriptional changes and coincides with fluctuations in cotranscriptional splicing, which lags behind at first. Unspliced transcripts remain here at the chromatin, but are already poly-adenylated. Later splicing readjusts, correlating with progressive Ser-2 phosphorylation of the CTD domain of RNAPII and activation of the elongation-complex pTEFb. Thus, rapid re-positioning of RNAPII and regulating the phosphorylation state of its CTD dictates almost all events during immune responses, including post-transcriptional processes. Overall design: ChIP-Seq of total RNA-Pol2 and H3K36me3 after 30min and 2h of T-cell stimulation compared to non-restimulated (NR) T-cells"
PRJEB14170,Ribosome footprinting upon oxidative stress treatment for wild-type and catalase2 knock-out mutants,Arabidopsis wild-type and catalase2 knock-out mutants were subjected to 3 hrs of high light intensities. Middle aged leaves were sampled and both mRNA-seq and ribo-seq data was generated before the onset of oxidative stress treatment and after 3 hrs of high light. This describes the ribo-seq data.
PRJNA369756,Ribosome profiling of HEK293 cells.,"The development of the ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) technique has enabled the measurement of translation at a genome-wide level. There are several variants of the ribosome profiling technique that use different translation inhibitors. The regular ribo-seq utilizes Cycloheximide (CHX), a translation elongation inhibitor to freeze all translating ribosomes. In contrast to CHX, the translation inhibitor lactimidomycin (LTM) and harringtonine (Harr) have a much stronger effect on initiating ribosomes. The use of these inhibitors allows for the global mapping of translating initiating sites (TISs) when they are coupled with ribosome profiling (TI-seq). We have developed a computational tool to detect and/or quantitatively compare translation initiation from TI-seq data, and predict novel ORFs from regular CHX-based ribo-seq data. Two replicates of CHX-based ribo-seq experiments and one Harr based ribo-seq were performed in HEK293 cells for confirming the ORFs predicted using public available data. Overall design: Ribosome protected fragments were extracted from HEK293 cells treated with cycloheximide or harringtonine plus cycloheximide."

PRJNA369543,RNA sequencing of primary human platelets and in vitro cell lines,"Platelets are anucleate cytoplasmic fragments that lack genomic DNA, but continue to synthesize protein using a pool of mRNAs, ribosomes, and regulatory small RNAs inherited from the precursor megakaryocyte (MK). The regulatory processes that shape the platelet transcriptome and the full scope of platelet translation have remained elusive. Using RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling of primary human platelets, we show the platelet transcriptome encompasses a subset of transcripts detected by RNA-Seq analysis of in vitro derived MK cells and these platelet-enriched transcripts are broadly occupied by ribosomes. We use RNA sequencing of synchronized populations of in vitro derived platelet-like particles (PLPs) to show that mRNA decay strongly shapes the nascent platelet transcriptome. Our data suggests that the decay of platelet mRNAs is slowed by the natural loss of the mRNA surveillance and ribosome rescue factor Pelota (PELO). Overall design: Analysis of RNA sequencing data from primary human platelets and in vitro derived platelet-like particles; manipulation by overexpression of Pelota (PELO) in Meg01/platelet-like particles."
PRJNA369542,Ribosome profiling and RNA-Sequencing of wild type and Pelota knockout mouse epidermis,"mRNA quality control mechanisms ensure fidelity of protein translation. An evolutionarily conserved component of the quality control machinery, Dom34/Pelota (Pelo), rescues stalled ribosomes.  Here we show that Pelo is required for mammalian epidermal homeostasis. Conditional deletion in murine epidermal stem cells expressing Lrig1 results in hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation, whereas deletion in other stem cells does not. Loss of Pelo results in truncated ribosome footprints and global upregulation of translation. Translational inhibition by rapamycin-mediated down regulation of mTOR rescues the epidermal phenotype. Our study reveals a novel role for the ribosome-rescue machinery in mammalian tissue homeostasis and an unanticipated specificity in its impact on different stem cell populations. Overall design: Analysis of ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing data from primary mouse epidermis; manipulation by transgenic knockout of Pelota (PELO)."
PRJNA362545,Profiling Ssb-Nascent Chain Interactions Reveals Principles of Hsp70-Assisted Folding,"The yeast Hsp70 chaperone Ssb interacts with ribosomes and nascent chains to co-translationally assist protein folding. Here, we present a proteome-wide analysis of Hsp70 function during translation, based on in vivo selective ribosome profiling, that reveals mechanistic principles coordinating translation with chaperone-assisted protein folding. Ssb binds most cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial proteins and a subset of ER proteins, supporting its general chaperone function. Position-resolved analysis of Ssb engagement reveals compartment- and protein-specific nascent chain binding profiles that are coordinated by emergence of positively charged peptide stretches enriched in aromatic amino acids. Ssbs' function is temporally coordinated by RAC but independent from NAC. Analysis of ribosome footprint densities along orfs reveals that ribosomes translate faster at times of Ssb binding. This is coordinated by biases in mRNA secondary structure, and codon usage as well as the action of Ssb, suggesting chaperones may allow higher protein synthesis rates by actively coordinating protein synthesis with co-translational folding. Overall design: Investigating the interaction of Ssb1 and Ssb2 with nascent polypeptide chains in four different strain backgrounds (WT, ssb1/2?, RAC?, NAC?) and the translation speed in WT and ssb1?ssb2 cells (all in replicates)."
PRJNA361113,Domestic chickens activate a piRNA defense against avian leukosis virus,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) protect the germ line by targeting transposable elements (TEs) through base-pair complementarity. We do not know how piRNAs co-evolve with TEs in chickens. Here we reported that all active TEs in the chicken germ line are targeted by piRNAs, and as TEs lose their activity, the corresponding piRNAs erode away. We observed de novo piRNA birth as host responds to a recent retroviral invasion. Avian leukosis virus (ALV) has endogenized prior to chicken domestication, remains infectious, and threatens poultry industry. Domestic fowl produced piRNAs targeting ALV from a genomic locus that was known to render its host ALV resistant. This genomic locus does not produce piRNAs in undomesticated wild chickens. Our findings uncover rapid piRNA evolution reflecting contemporary TE activity, identify a new piRNA acquisition modality by activating a pre-existing genomic locus, and extend piRNA defense roles to include the period when endogenous retroviruses are still infectious. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing of rooster testes"
PRJNA360112,The novel lysine specific methyltransferase METTL21B affects mRNA translation through inducible and dynamic methylation of Lys-165 in human eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A),"Lysine methylation is abundant on histone proteins, representing a dynamic regulator of chromatin state and gene activity, but is also frequent on many nonhistone proteins, including eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A). However, the functional significance of eEF1Amethylation remains obscure and it has remained unclear whether eEF1A methylation is dynamic and subject to active regulation. We here demonstrate, using a wide range of in vitro and in vivo approaches, that the previously uncharacterized human methyltransferase METTL21B specifically targets Lys-165 in eEF1A in an aminoacyl-tRNA- and GTP-dependent manner. Interestingly, METTL21B mediated eEF1A methylation showed strong variation across different tissues and cell lines, and was induced by altering growth conditions or by treatment with certain ER-stress-inducing drugs, concomitant with an increase in METTL21B gene expression. Moreover, genetic ablation of METTL21B function in mammalian cells caused substantial alterations in mRNA translation, as measured by ribosome profiling. A non-canonical function for eEF1A in organization of the cellular cytoskeleton has been reported, and interestingly, METTL21B accumulated in centrosomes, in addition to the expected cytosolic localization. In summary, the present study identifies METTL21B as the enzyme responsible for methylation of eEF1A on Lys-165 and shows that this modification is dynamic, inducible and likely of regulatory importance. Overall design: Ribosome profiling libraries from haploid human cells from both wt and METTL21B knockouts."
PRJNA359690,The human CCHC-type Zinc Finger nucleic acid binding protein binds G-rich elements in target mRNA coding sequences initiation promotes translation (Ribosome profiling).,"CNBP is a eukaryote-conserved nucleic-acid binding protein required in mammals for embryonic development. It contains seven CCHC-type zinc-finger domains and was suggested to act as a nucleic acid chaperone, as well as a transcription factor. Here, we identify all CNBP isoforms as cytoplasmic messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding proteins. Using Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside Enhanced Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation, we mapped its binding sites on RNA at nucleotide-level resolution on a genome-wide scale and find that CNBP interacted with 3961 mRNAs in human cell lines, preferentially at a G-rich motif close to the AUG start codon on mature mRNAs. Loss- and gain-of-function analyses coupled with system-wide RNA and protein quantification revealed that CNBP did not affect RNA abundance, but rather promoted translation of its targets. This is consistent with an RNA chaperone function of CNBP helping to resolve secondary structures, thus promoting translation. Overall design: CNBP protein knockout and Ribosome profiling"
PRJNA358868,Endoplasmic reticulum as a hub organizing microRNAs and a subset of endogenous siRNAs in Arabidopsis [Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq],"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was implicated as the site of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated translational repression in plants. Here, we examined the ER- and rough ER- associated small RNAome, transcriptome and translatome. We found that nearly all cellular transcripts were present on membrane-bound polysomes (MBPs), and miRNAs and a small set of endogenous siRNAs were particularly enriched on MBPs. The MBP- enriched miRNAs and siRNAs associated with, and were recruited to membranes by, their effector protein ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1). AGO1 associated with ER in a partly RNA-independent manner. Reduced membrane association of 22-nt miRNAs, which trigger the biogenesis of phased, secondary siRNAs (phasiRNAs) from their target transcripts, was accompanied by decreased production or loss of phasing of phasiRNAs. The phasiRNA precursor transcripts, previously thought to be noncoding, were associated with MBPs in a manner that supported phasiRNA production. These findings point to the ER as a hub that hosts and organizes endogenous small RNAs in plants.

PRJNA356775,RNAseq and ribosome profiling of yeast cells grown under methionine restriction condition.,"We characterize the translational and transcriptional programs induced by MetR and investigate the potential mechanisms through which methionine regulates gene expression, using the budding yeast S. cerevisiae as the model organism. Using ribosomal profiling and RNA-seq, we systematically compared the translational and transcriptional profiles of cells growing in the normal and methionine restricted media. We observed a broad spectrum of gene expression changes in response to MetR, including hundreds of genes whose transcript level and/or translational efficiency changed significantly. These genes fall into specific functional classes that are informative of the physiological state of the cell under MetR. Analysis of ribosome loading patterns of genes with increased translational efficiency suggested mechanisms both similar and different from the canonical model of translational regulation by general amino acid starvation. Analysis of the genes with decreased translational efficiency added support to the thiolation model of translational regulation by methionine. Since MetR extends the lifespan of many species, the list of genes we identified in this study can be good candidates for studying the downstream effectors of lifespan extension. Overall design: The initial cell culture was incubated in 300 ml SD medium overnight to an OD600 0.8~1.0, then diluted by five fold using fresh SD media and incubated for another 4 hours under 30oC to an OD600 0.8~1.0. The sample was then divided equally into two aliquots. Cells were separated from the media by spin-down at 3000 g for 5 minutes and re-suspended in SD and MetR media respectively. All samples were incubated for another hour before harvesting. All the steps were carried out at 30°C. Raw sequences were obtained from Illumina Hiseq 2000."
PRJNA356772,REPARATION:  Ribosome Profiling Assisted (Re-) Annotation of Bacterial genomes,"The delineation of genes in bacteria has remained an important challenge because prokaryotic genomes are often tightly packed frequently resulting in overlapping genes. We hereby present a de novo approach called REPARATION (RibosomeE Profiling Assisted (Re-)AnnotaTION) to delineate translated open reading frames (ORFs) in bacteria independent of (available) genome annotation. By deep sequencing of ribosome protected mRNA fragments (RPF) to map translating ribosomes across the entire genome, REPARATION takes advantage of the recently developed ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) technique. REPARATION starts by traversing the entire genome to generate all possible ORFs and then collects their corresponding RPF signal information. Based on a growth curve model to estimate minimum ORF read density and Ribo-seq RPF coverage, thresholds indicative of translation is estimated. Finally, our algorithm applies a random forest model to build a classifier to classify putative protein coding ORFs. We evaluated the performance of REPARATION on 3 annotated bacterial species using in-house generated Ribo-seq data and matching N-terminal and shotgun proteomics data next to publically available Ribo-seq data. In all cases, about 80% of the ORFs predicted by REPARATION were previously annotated as protein coding. While 13-20% were variants of previously annotated ORFs and about 3-4% point to novel translated ORFs within intergenic or other regions previously annotated as non-coding. Without stringent length restrictions REPARATION was able to identify several small ORFs (sORFs). Multiple supportive evidence from matching MS data and sequence conservation analysis was obtained to validate predicted ORFs. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and mRNA sequencing of monosome and polysome-enriched samples of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium - strain SL1344."
PRJNA356354,Ubiquitination of Stalled Ribosome Triggers Ribosome-associated Quality Control [SET2],"Translation elongation stalling has the potential to produce toxic truncated protein fragments. Translation of either non-stop mRNA or transcripts coding for poly-basic sequences induces ribosome stalling, and the arrest product is degraded by the ribosome-mediated quality control (RQC) system. During this process, the stalled ribosome is dissociated into subunits, and the polypeptide is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin on the 60S large ribosomal subunit, leading to subsequent proteasomal degradation. However, it is largely unknown how the specific stalled ribosomes are recognized as aberrant to engage the RQC system. Here, we report that ubiquitination of the ribosomal protein uS10 of the 40S small ribosomal subunit, by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hel2 (or RQC-trigger (Rqt) 1) initiates RQC. We identified a novel RQC-trigger (RQT) complex composed of the RNA helicase-family protein Slh1/Rqt2, the ubiquitin binding protein Cue3/Rqt3, and yKR023W/Rqt4 that is required for RQC. The defects in RQC of the RQT mutants correlated with sensitivity to anisomycin, which stalls ribosome at the rotated form, suggesting that RQT factors rescue ribosomes stalled by this drug. Our un-biased survey by ribosome profiling revealed that ribosomes stalled at the rotated state with specific pairs of codons at P-A sites serve as RQC substrates. Rqt1 specifically ubiquitinates these arrested ribosomes to target them to the RQT complex, allowing subsequent RQC reactions including dissociation of the stalled ribosome into subunits. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the surveillance system for aberrant proteins induced by ribosome stalling and mediated by ribosome ubiquitination. Overall design: Ribosome profiling samples are obtained from wild type and RQT mutant  (rqt1, rqt2, uS10KR, Rqt1DeltaRingDomain) yeast with 2 replications."

PRJNA354729,Ribosome profiling of G2019S LRRK2 human dopamine neurons,G2019S mutaion of LRRK2 is known to increase mRNA translation. We perform ribosome profiling to study defective translation using human dopamine neuron models. Patient-derived human dopamine neurons with G2019S LRRK2 mutation were generated and used. Also a mutation-corrected isogenic pair line was used. Overall design: hDA neurons: 60 days old samples were used.
PRJNA354388,Translation efficiency is maintained during heat shock in Escherichia coli,"We utilize ribosome profiling to directly monitor translation in E. coli at 30 °C and investigate how this changes after 10-20 minutes of heat shock at 42 °C. Translation is controlled by the interplay of several RNA hybridization processes, which are expected to be temperature sensitive. We observe that translation efficiencies are robustly maintained after thermal heat shock and after mimicking the heat shock response transcriptional program at 30 °C. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analysis of E. coli was used to measure translation efficiency. The effect of heat shock was measured under 3 conditions (n=3); overexpression of wildtype (n=3) or constitutively active mutant (n=2) heat shock transcription factor rpoH was compared to cells expressing empty vector (n=4)."
PRJNA354320,Cell-type-specific gene expression profiling using ribosome affinity purification,"Post-transcriptional regulation including mRNA binding to ribosomes plays an important role in determining cell-type-specific gene expression patterns. Here, we applied an approach that profiles cell-type-specific mRNAs. The Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification method (TRAP; Heiman et al., Cell, 2008 and Doyle et al., Cell, 2008) was developed in mice and has been combined with the UAS/Gal4 system in Drosophila (Thomas et al., PLoS ONE, 2012). TRAP is a powerful method to find cell-type-specific differences at the level of the 'translatome' (Dougherty, Schmidt, Nakajima, & Heintz, Nucleic Acids Research, 2010). In parallel to published efforts, we developed and implemented the method for the fly and compared distinct head cell types and identified cell-type-specific transcript classes with neuronal (e.g. receptor-, neuropeptide- or hormone activity) or glial function (e.g. transporter activity). Neuronal TRAP genes are over-represented in the brain, larval CNS and thoracico-abdominal ganglion (Chintapalli, Wang, & Dow, Nature Genetics, 2007). Using cell-type-to-cell-type comparisons (e.g. neurons vs. glia), instead of a given cell population to the total (e.g. neurons vs. head), the differences could be identified with greater resolution. TRAP uncovered more neuronal genes compared to neuronal RNA polymerase II ChIP-seq data (Schauer et al., Cell Reports, 2013). Thus, TRAP data confirm the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in defining cell identity. TRAP is one of the best methods to reveal differential omics data among distinct cell types by profiling ribosome-bound mRNAs. TRAP is a promising tool to reveal cell-type-specific transcriptional and translational changes in a perturbed environment. Overall design: This dataset contains cell-type-specific ribosome-bound mRNA-seq profiles. Input and IP samples from Drosophila adult head neurons, glia and fat body."

PRJNA353260,Ribosome Profiling Reveals Translational Upregulation of Cellular Oxidative  Phosphorylation mRNAs During Vaccinia Virus-induced Host Shutoff,"The experiment procedures were described previously (13). Briefly, ribosome profiling was carried out as described elsewhere with minor modifications (10). VACV (at an multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 10)- and mock-infected HeLa S3 cells pretreated with translational inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) were lysed and treated with DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA), and the lysate was clarified. Messenger RNA was isolated from a portion of the lysate using oligo(dT) and fragmented using RNaseIII (New England Biolab, MA). The mRNA fragments between 50 and 80 nucleotides (nt) were extracted. The ribosome-protected RNA fragments (RPFs) were separated by electrophoresis after the lysate was digested with RNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the RPFs between 28 and 34 nts were isolated. The purified mRNA and RPFs were used to generate libraries for deep sequencing as described previously (10). The purified libraries were sequenced using a HiSeq 2000 system."
PRJNA352976,Ribosome profiling study of eIF5A depletion strain,"The eukaryotic translation factor eIF5A, originally identified as an initiation factor, was later shown to promote translation elongation of iterated proline sequences. Using a combination of ribosome profiling and in vitro biochemistry, we report a much broader role for eIF5A in elongation and uncover a substantial function for eIF5A in termination. Ribosome profiling of an eIF5A-depleted strain reveals a global elongation defect, with abundant ribosomes stalling at many sequences, not limited to proline stretches. Our data also show accumulation at stop codons and in the 3'-UTR, suggesting a global defect in termination in the absence of eIF5A. Using an in vitro reconstituted translation system, we find that eIF5A strongly promotes the translation of novel stalling sequences and increases the rate of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis more than 17-fold. We conclude that eIF5A functions broadly in elongation and termination, rationalizing its great cellular abundance and essential nature. Overall design: 8 biological samples are included in the study (8 ribosome footprinting samples). These include wild-type and eIF5A depletion strains (with biological replicates). Also included are ribosome footprint profiling after high salt treatment."

PRJNA350544,Global analysis of gene expression reveals mRNA superinduction is required for the inducible immune response to a bacterial pathogen,"The inducible innate immune response to infection requires a concerted process of gene expression that is regulated at multiple levels. Most global analyses of the innate immune response have focused on transcription induced by defined immunostimulatory ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide. However, the response to pathogens involves additional complexity, as pathogens interfere with virtually every step of gene expression. How cells respond to pathogen-mediated disruption of gene expression to nevertheless initiate protective responses remains unclear. We previously discovered that a pathogen-mediated blockade of host protein synthesis provokes the production of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. It remains unclear how these cytokines are produced despite the global pathogen-induced block of translation. We addressed this question by using parallel RNAseq and ribosome profiling to characterize the response of macrophages to infection with the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila. Our results reveal that mRNA superinduction is required for the inducible immune response to a bacterial pathogen. Overall design: Transcriptional and translational responses of bone marrow macrophages to infection with Legionella pneumophila were measured by RNAseq and ribosome profiling following standard protocols."
PRJNA350543,Consequences of Ribosomal Protein Haploinsufficiency in Human Hematopoiesis,"Ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency (RPH) underlies diverse human diseases with distinct and specific phenotypes, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). Although multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the erythroid-specific hematopoietic defects observed in DBA, only recently has the role of selectively impaired translation been highlighted in these phenotypes. Exactly how and to what extent this impairment of translation occurs is currently unknown. Here, by identifying a novel DBA gene affecting ribosome biogenesis, we show that both RPH and impaired ribosome biogenesis (IRB) limit the availability of actively translating ribosomes, resulting in the hematopoietic and translational defects observed in DBA. Our results show that the selective impairment of translation is due to a quantitative defect, where ribosomes of invariant protein composition have a reduced abundance, rather than a qualitative defect, where a subset of ribosomes lack specific ribosomal proteins (RPs) and thus may have altered translational capacity. In RPH, we find that cellular RP homeostasis is largely maintained through translational co-regulation, and we identify a selective subset of transcripts that have impaired association with the ribosome. Surprisingly, these transcripts have short and unstructured 5' UTRs and are highly abundant and efficiently translated in healthy human erythroid progenitors, suggesting that the impaired translation of a number of key transcripts, including GATA1, may underlie DBA. Overall, our study identifies mechanisms by which RPH and IRB affect mRNA translation, illuminating how these alterations can result in cell-type specific defects and cause human disease. Overall design: (mRNA-seq) RNA-seq for control (shLuc), RPL5 knockdown (shRPL5), RPS19 knockdown (shRPS19), and TSR2 knockdown (shTSR2) was performed for two biological replicates of primary human erythroid cells at Day 7 of in vitro culture. (RPF-seq) Ribosome profiling was similarly performed for shLuc, shRPL5, and shRPS19 in the matching biological replicates."

PRJNA349752,Nat1 promotes translation of specific proteins that induce differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells [ribosome profiling],"Nat1 (also known as p97/Dap5/Eif4g2) is a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein that is homologous to the C-terminal two thirds of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (also known as Eif4g1). We previously showed that Nat1-null mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were resistant to differentiation. In the current study, we found that Nat1 and Eif4g1 share many binding proteins, such as Eif3s, Eif4s and ribosomal proteins. However, Nat1 did not bind to Eif4e or poly A binding proteins, which are critical for cap-dependent translation initiation. In contrast, Nat1 binds to Eif2s, Fmr and related proteins, and Prrc2 proteins more preferentially than does Eif4g1. We also found that Nat1-null mESCs possess a status partially similar to ground state, which is established in wild-type mES cells when treated with inhibitors of the ERK and GSK3 signaling pathways. In Nat1-null mESCs, the ERK pathway is suppressed even without inhibitors. Ribosomal profiling revealed that translation of Map3k3 and Sos1 is suppressed in the absence of Nat1. Forced expression of Map3k3 induced differentiation of Nat1-null mESCs. These data collectively showed that Nat1 is involved in translation of proteins that are required for cell differentiation. Overall design: Examining ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPF) and total RNA in replicate WT ESCs (n=2), Nat1+/- mESCs (n=3) and Nat1-null ESCs (n=3)."
PRJNA348553,N-terminal Proteomics Assisted Profiling of the Unexplored Translation Initiation Landscape in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Proteogenomics is an emerging research field yet lacking a standard method of analysis. In this article, we demonstrate the strength of proteogenomic analysis specific for N-terminal data that aims at the discovery of novel translational start sites. In summary, unidentified spectra were matched to a specific N-terminal peptide library encompassing all theoretical protein N-termini encoded in the genome. Gene prediction suggested 81 protein-coding models, of which several alternative proteoforms with unannotated protein starts. Next to the proteomic data, complementary ribosome footprinting data was generated from Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures. Translation initiation site mapping by the ribosome footprinting data provided orthogonal evidence for 14 novel peptides identified by our proteogenomics pipeline. Overall design: Ribosome profiling sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type ecotype Landsberg erecta cells treated with lactimidomycin or cycloheximide."
PRJNA348358,Global analysis of translation termination in E. coli using release factor manipulations,"Terminating protein translation accurately and efficiently is critical for both protein fidelity and ribosome recycling for continued translation. The three bacterial release factors (RFs) play key roles:  RF1 and 2 recognize stop codons and terminate translation; and RF3 promotes disassociation of bound release factors. Probing release factors mutations with reporter constructs containing programmed frameshifting sequences or premature stop codons had revealed a propensity for readthrough or frameshifting at these specific sites, but their effects on translation genome-wide have not been examined. We performed ribosome profiling on a set of isogenic strains with well-characterized release factor mutations to determine how they alter translation globally.  Consistent with their known defects, strains with increasingly severe release factor defects exhibit increasingly severe accumulation of ribosomes over stop codons, indicative of an increased duration of the termination/release phase of translation. Release factor mutant strains also exhibit increased occupancy in the region following the stop codon at a significant number of genes.  Our global analysis revealed that, as expected, translation termination is generally efficient and accurate, but that at a significant number of genes (= 50) the ribosome signature after the stop codon is suggestive of translation past the stop codon. Even native E. coli K-12 exhibits the ribosome signature suggestive of protein extension, especially at UGA codons, which rely exclusively on the reduced function RF2 allele of the K-12 strain for termination. Deletion of RF3 increases the severity of the defect.  We unambiguously demonstrate readthrough and frameshifting protein extensions and their further accumulation in mutant strains for a few select cases. In addition to enhancing recoding, ribosome accumulation over stop codons disrupts attenuation control of biosynthetic operons, and may alter expression of some overlapping genes.  Together, these functional alterations may either augment the protein repertoire or produce deleterious proteins. Overall design: Samples of WT, ?RF3, RF2B, and RF2B?RF3 were analyzed by ribosome profiling and RNA-seq. Over 4 experiments there are 4 replicates of WT, 2 replicates of ?RF3, 2 replicates of RF2B and 5 replicates of RF2B?RF3. One experiment (both ribosome profiling and RNA-seq) was performed in minimal media with a single sample for WT and ?RF3"

PRJNA347980,Identification of unannotated small genes in Salmonella,"Bacterial genomes serve as a blueprint in all aspects of biological research, and therefore accurate annotation is of paramount importance. However, increasing evidence suggests annotated bacterial genomes have missed many, if not all, small genes encoding proteins =60 amino acids. To uncover unannotated small genes in Salmonella enterica, we used a genomic technique ‘ribosome profiling’ that provides a snapshot of all mRNAs being translated (translatome). For comprehensive identification of the small genes, we obtained Salmonella translatomes in four different growth conditions including Luria-Bertani medium, MOPS rich defined medium, N-minimal medium with low Mg2+ (10 µM), and N-minimal medium at pH 5.7, respectively. Ribosome profiling data were analysed in combination with in silico predicted putative open reading frames and transcriptome profiles. As a result, we uncovered 127 previously unannotated genes, the majority of which were small genes encoding proteins =50 amino acids. We validated expression by western blot of the identified unannotated small genes, the smallest of which is 7-amino acid long. Because some unannotated small genes identified in this study are only expressed in the infection-relevant low Mg2+ conditions, they are likely involved in cellular processes required for Salmonella virulence. Our findings suggest that currently sequenced bacterial genomes are likely under-annotated with regard to small genes and need to be revised. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq were performed on Salmonella enterica 14028s cells grown in four different growth conditions."

Translational regulation depends on context-dependent differences in the protein output of mRNAs, but the key mRNA features that distinguish efficiently translated mRNAs are largely unknown. Here we comprehensively determined the RNA-binding preferences of the initiation factor eIF4G to assess whether this core translation initiation factor has intrinsic sequence preferences that contribute to preferential translation of specific mRNAs.

PRJNA345228,Coordinated Activities of Multiple Myc-Dependent and Myc-Independent Biosynthetic Pathways in Hepatoblastoma,"Hepatoblastoma (HB) is associated with aberrant activation of the b-catenin and Hippo/YAP signaling pathways. Over-expression of mutant b-catenin and YAP in mice induces HBs that express high levels of c-Myc (Myc).  In light of recent observations that Myc in unnecessary for long-term hepatocyte proliferation, we have now examined its role in HB pathogenesis using the above model. While Myc was found to be dispensable for in vivo HB initiation it was necessary to sustain rapid tumor growth. Gene expression profiling identified key molecular differences between myc+/+ (WT) and myc-/- (KO) hepatocytes and HBs that explain these behaviors. In HBs, these included both Myc-dependent and Myc-independent increases in families of transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins, non-structural factors affecting ribosome assembly and function and enzymes catalyzing glycolysis, lipid bio-synthesis and fatty acid b-oxidation. Myc-independent metabolic changes associated with HBs included dramatic reductions in mitochondrial mass and oxidative function and increases in ATP content and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Myc-dependent metabolic changes included higher levels of neutral lipid and acetyl-CoA in WT tumors. The latter correlated with higher histone H3 acetylation. Collectively, our results indicate that Myc’s role in HB pathogenesis is to impose mutually dependent changes in gene expression and metabolic re-programming that are unattainable in non-transformed cells and that cooperate to maximize tumor growth. Overall design: 4 individual sets each of Myc WT and KO hepatocytes, and 5 individual sets each of Myc WT and KO Hepatoblastoma"
PRJNA344393,eIF1 modulates the recognition of sub-optimal translation start sites and steers gene expression control mediated by uORFs,"Alternative translation initiation mechanisms such as leaky scanning and reinitiation potentiate the polycistronic nature of transcripts. By allowing for reprogrammed translation, these mechanisms can mediate biological responses to stress stimuli. We combined proteomics with ribosome profiling and mRNA sequencing to identify the biological targets of translation control triggered by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 (eIF1), a protein implicated in the stringency of start codon selection. We quantified expression changes of over 4,000 proteins and 10,000 actively translated transcripts, leading to the identification of 245 transcripts undergoing translational control mediated by upstream open reading frames (uORFs) upon eIF1 deprivation. The stringency of start codon selection and preference for optimal nucleotide context were largely diminished leading to translational regulation of uORFs with sub-optimal start sites. Affected genes were implicated in energy production and sensing of metabolic stress. Interestingly, knockdown of eIF1 elicited a synergic response from eIF5 and eIF1B. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and mRNA sequening of human HCT116 cells upon eIF1 knockdown and in control conditions."

PRJNA342154,Context-specific inhibition of translation by ribosomal antibiotics targeting the peptidyl transferase center,"We report the context-specific activity of two peptidyl transferase targeting antibiotics, chloramphenicol and linezolid. By generating ribosome profiling data in the presence or absence of either chloramphenicol or linezolid we mapped the relative change of ribosome density induced by these antibiotics. We find that both inhibitors preferentially arrest ribosomes that carry either an alanine, serine, or threonine in the penultimate (-1) position of the nascent peptide chain. Additionally ribosomes that carry a glycine in either the P site (0) or A-site (+1) counteract the inhibitory activity of both inhibitors. The context-specific action of chloramphenicol illuminates the operation of the mechanism of inducible resistance that relies on programmed drug-induced translation arrest. In addition, our findings expose the functional interplay between the nascent chain and the peptidyl transferase center. Overall design: Ribosome profiling was performed on BWDK (-tolC) cells treated with a high concentration of either inhibitor and compared to a no antibiotic control."
PRJNA342004,Proteomic and genomic characterization of a yeast model for Ogden syndrome [RNA-seq and Ribo-seq],"Naa10 is a Na-terminal acetyltransferase that, in a complex with its auxiliary subunit Naa15, co-translationally acetylates the a-amino group of newly synthetized proteins as they emerge from the ribosome. Roughly 40-50% of the human proteome is acetylated by Naa10, rendering this an enzyme with one of the most broad substrate ranges known. Recently, we reported an X-linked disorder of infancy, Ogden syndrome, in two families harboring a c.109T>C (p.Ser37Pro) variant in NAA10. In the present study we performed in-depth characterization of a yeast model of Ogden syndrome. Stress tests and proteomic analyses suggest that the S37P mutation disrupts Naa10 function and reduces cellular fitness during heat shock, possibly due to dysregulation of chaperone expression and accumulation. Microarray and RNA-seq revealed a pseudo-diploid gene expression profile in ?Naa10 cells, likely responsible for a mating defect. In conclusion, the data presented here further support the disruptive nature of the S37P/Ogden mutation and identify affected cellular processes potentially contributing to the severe phenotype seen in Ogden syndrome.

NMD substrates exhibited a striking difference in normalized ribosome occupancy in wild-type and UPF1? cells. We also found that normal looking NMD substrates have higher ratio of out of frame reads, lower codon optimalites and a higher propensity to have long stretches of non-optimal codons.

PRJNA339870,Global studies of eIF5B function in Arabidopsis,"The translation initiation factor eIF5B is a GTPase that acts late in the translation initiation process and is one of two universally conserved translation initiation factors. However, the molecular mechanism by which eIF5B is involved in plant development and environmental response remains unknown. In this study, we found that a missense mutation in an eIF5B gene in Arabidopsis thaliana (eIF5B-1; At1g76810) prevents acclimation to high temperature and that severe alleles have multiple growth defects. Surprisingly, Arabidopsis has three other eIF5B genes, none of which is capable of substituting for eIF5B-1 in thermotolerance or growth. One of these other genes, eIF5B-2 (At1g21160) shows differences in level and tissue distribution of expression explaining its inability to complement the eIF5B-1 mutants. The other two genes, eIF5B-3 (At1g76720) and eIF5B-4 (At1g76820) have clearly undergone evolutionary conversion to a non-functional state. The thermotolerance-defective eIF5B-1 allele, a Ser substitution of a highly conserved Gly residue in Domain II, grows normally in the absence of stress. However, polysome profiling and RNA-seq analysis show delayed recovery of translation after heat stress and reduced polysome loading of certain heat shock protein (HSP) mRNAs. A second mutant allele that truncates eIF5B-1 by 30 aa, shows a significantly reduced growth rate. Polysome profiling reveals a dramatic increase in small polysomes and selective changes in polysome loading in the truncation mutant compared to wild type. RNA-seq data suggest that the mutant selectively decreases translation efficiency of auxin and ribosome related genes. We speculate that the phenotypes of these eIF5B-1 mutants result from the requirement for optimal eIF5B activity for translation of specific mRNAs, rather than arising solely from reduced overall translation initiation."
PRJNA339793,Translation of poly(A) tails leads to precise mRNA cleavage and widespread ribosome rescue,"Translation of poly(A) tails leads to mRNA cleavage but the mechanism and global pervasiveness of this “nonstop/no-go” decay process is not understood. Here we performed ribosome profiling of short 15-18 nt mRNA footprints to identify ribosomes stalled at 3’ ends of mRNA decay intermediates. We found mRNA cleavage extending hundreds of nucleotides upstream of ribosome stalling in poly(A) and predominantly in one reading frame. These observations suggest that cleavage is closely associated with the ribosome. Surprisingly, ribosomes appeared to stall when as few as 3 consecutive ORF-internal lysine codons were positioned in the A, P, and E sites though significant mRNA degradation was not observed. Endonucleolytic cleavage was widespread, however, at sites of premature polyadenylation and rescue of the ribosomes stalled at these sites was dependent on Dom34. These results suggest this process may be critical when changes in polyadenylation occur during development, tumorigenesis, or when translation termination/recycling is impaired. Overall design: 14 samples are included in the study (2 mRNA-Seq samples and 12 ribosome footprinting samples). Read sizes were examined for lengths of 15-18 nt or 25-34 nt or both in some cases, reads were aligned by 5'' or 3'' ends or both in some cases."
PRJNA339577,"Ribosome profiling of human platelets, reticulocytes, and in vitro cell lines","Translation is a fundamental biological process and ribosomes are essential in all  cells, but defects in ribosome biogenesis (ribosomopathies) disproportionately  cause hematopoietic dysfunction of red blood cells and platelets. Here, we  analyze translation in primary human reticulocytes and platelets by ribosome  profiling and uncover dramatic accumulation of post-termination, unrecycled  ribosomes in the 3´UTRs of mRNAs. We then demonstrate that these ribosomes  accumulate as a result of the natural loss of the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1  during terminal differentiation. We find that induction of ribosome rescue factors  PELO and HBS1L is required to maintain translational homeostasis when ABCE1  levels fall. This activation of ribosome rescue mitigates the effects of ribosome  shortage on translational output, including on hemoglobin production. Our  observations suggest that this distinctive loss of ABCE1 in anucleate blood  lineages sensitizes them to defects in ribosome homeostasis and that activation  of a ribosome rescue pathway plays a lineage-specific role in maintaining  ribosome homeostasis during blood cell development. Overall design: Analysis of ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing data from primary human platelets, primary human reticulocytes, in vitro derived platelet-like particles, and hemin-induced differentiation of K562 cells; manipulation by knockdown and overexpression of Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L in K562 cells and Meg01/platelet-like particles."
PRJNA339062,The SND proteins constitute an alternative targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum,"In eukaryotes, up to one-third of cellular proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they undergo folding, processing, sorting and trafficking to subsequent endomembrane compartments. Targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum has been shown to occur co-translationally by the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway or post-translationally by the mammalian transmembrane recognition complex of 40?kDa (TRC40) and homologous yeast guided entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathways. Despite the range of proteins that can be catered for by these two pathways, many proteins are still known to be independent of both SRP and GET, so there seems to be a critical need for an additional dedicated pathway for endoplasmic reticulum relay. We set out to uncover additional targeting proteins using unbiased high-content screening approaches. To this end, we performed a systematic visual screen using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and uncovered three uncharacterized proteins whose loss affected targeting. We suggest that these proteins work together and demonstrate that they function in parallel with SRP and GET to target a broad range of substrates to the endoplasmic reticulum. The three proteins, which we name Snd1, Snd2 and Snd3 (for SRP-independent targeting), can synthetically compensate for the loss of both the SRP and GET pathways, and act as a backup targeting system. This explains why it has previously been difficult to demonstrate complete loss of targeting for some substrates. Our discovery thus puts in place an essential piece of the endoplasmic reticulum targeting puzzle, highlighting how the targeting apparatus of the eukaryotic cell is robust, interlinked and flexible.

PRJNA338762,A ribosome profiling study of mRNA cleavage by the endonuclease RelE,"Implicated in persistence and stress response pathways in bacteria, RelE shuts down protein synthesis by cleaving mRNA within the ribosomal A site. Structural and biochemical studies have shown that RelE cuts with some sequence specificity, which we further characterize here, and that it shows no activity outside the context of the ribosome. We obtained a global view of the effect of RelE on translation by ribosome profiling, observing that ribosomes accumulate on the 5’-end of genes through dynamic cycles of mRNA cleavage, ribosome rescue, and initiation. Moreover, the addition of purified RelE to cell lysates shows promise as a method for generating ribosome footprints. In bacteria, profiling studies have suffered from relatively low resolution and have yielded no information on reading frame due to problems inherent to MNase digestion, the method used to degrade unprotected regions of mRNA. In contrast, we find that RelE yields precise 3’-ends that for the first time reveal reading frame in bacteria. Given that RelE has been shown to function in all three domains of life, RelE has potential to improve reading frame and shed light on A-site occupancy in ribosome profiling experiments more broadly. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNAseq of E. coli MG1655, both WT and overexpressing RelE."
PRJNA336542,CAN1 Arginine Permease Deficiency Extends Yeast Replicative Lifespan via Translational Activation of Stress Response Genes,"Transcriptional regulation plays an important role in the control of gene expression during aging. However, translation efficiency likely plays an equally important role in determining protein abundance, but has been relatively under studied in this context. Here we used RNA-seq and ribosome profiling to investigate the role of translational regulation in lifespan extension by CAN1 gene deletion in yeast. Through comparison of the transcriptional and translational changes in cells lacking CAN1 with other long-lived mutants, we were able to identify critical regulatory factors, including transcription factors and mRNA-binding proteins, that coordinate transcriptional and translational responses. Together, our data support a model in which deletion of CAN1 extends replicative lifespan through increased translation of proteins that facilitate cellular response to stress. This study extends our understanding of the importance of translational control in regulating stress resistance and longevity. Overall design: RNA-seq and ribosome profiling analyses of wild-type, can1, rpl22a, and tor1 knockout strains"
PRJNA336005,Post-Translational Dosage Compensation Buffers Genetic Perturbations to Stoichiometry of Protein Complexes,"Understanding buffering mechanisms for various perturbations is essential for understanding robustness in cellular systems. Protein-level dosage compensation, which arises when changes in gene copy number do not translate linearly into protein level, is one mechanism for buffering against genetic perturbations. Here, we present an approach to identify genes with dosage compensation by increasing the copy number of individual genes using the genetic tug-of-war technique. Our screen of chromosome I suggests that dosage-compensated genes constitute approximately 10% of the genome and consist predominantly of subunits of multi-protein complexes. Importantly, because subunit levels are regulated in a stoichiometry-dependent manner, dosage compensation plays a crucial role in maintaining subunit stoichiometries. Indeed, we observed changes in the levels of a complex when its subunit stoichiometries were perturbed. We further analyzed compensation mechanisms using a proteasome-defective mutant as well as ribosome profiling, which provided strong evidence for compensation by ubiquitin-dependent degradation but not reduced translational efficiency. Thus, our study provides a systematic understanding of dosage compensation and highlights that this post-translational regulation is a critical aspect of robustness in cellular systems. Overall design: Ribosome profiling for Sample1-4. RNA-seq for Sample 5-8. Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq were performed upon the experimental condition where cells carry a high copy of Pop5 gene cloned into a multicopy plasmid and the control condition where they carry empty vector. For ribosome profiling, Sample 1, 2 (experimental condition) and Sample 3, 4 (control condition) are biological replicates of each condition. For RNA-seq, Sample 5, 6  (experimental condition) and Sample 7, 8  (control condition) are biological replicates of each condition."
PRJNA330982,Dual randomization of oligonucleotides to reduce the bias in ribosome-profiling libraries,"Protein translation is at the heart of cellular metabolism and its in-depth characterization is key for many lines of research. Recently, ribosome profiling became the state-of-the-art method to quantitatively characterize translation dynamics at a transcriptome-wide level. However, the strategy of library generation affects its outcomes. Here, we present a modified ribosomeprofiling protocol starting from yeast, human cells and vertebrate brain tissue. We use a DNA linker carrying four randomized positions at its 5’  and a reverse-transcription (RT) primer with three randomized positions to reduce artifacts during library preparation. The use of seven randomized nucleotides allows to efficiently detect library-generation artifacts. We find that the effect of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) artifacts is relatively small for global analyses when sufficient input material is used. However, when input material is limiting, our strategy improves the sensitivity of gene-specific analyses. Furthermore, randomized nucleotides alleviate the skewed frequency of specific sequences at the 3’  end of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) likely resulting from ligase specificity. Finally, strategies that rely on dual ligation show a high degree of gene-coverage variation. Taken together, our approach helps to remedy two of the main problems associated with ribosome-profiling data. This will facilitate the analysis of translational dynamics and increase our understanding of the influence of RNA modifications on translation. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq libraries from wt yeast comparing different library preparation approaches using different combinations of randomized and non-randomized linkers and RT primers."
PRJNA328483,Balanced activation of IspG and IspH to eliminate intermediate accumulation and improve isoprenoids production in Escherichia coli,"Purpose: To understand the dynamic transcriptional response of Escherichia coli cells to intracellular HMBPP accumulation. Methods: RNA-seq libraries were constructed for three samples, including (I) CAR005, which used as control; (II) IspG1, which strong over-expressed ispG in CAR005; (III) G4H14, which simultaneously over-expressed ispG and ispH in CAR005.For preparation of RNA samples, single colonies were inoculated into 15x100 mm tubes containing 4 ml LB, and grown at 30ºC and 250 rpm overnight. 100 µl seed culture was inoculated into a 100 ml flask containing 10 ml LB medium, and grown at 30ºC and 250 rpm. After 5 h, 1 ml culture was harvested by centrifugation, frozen in liquid nitrogen and sent to Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, Shenzhen, China). The three 90-nt paired-end RNA-seq libraries were generated commercially at Beijing Genomics Institute by using the HiSeq™ 2000 platform. Sequencing data was handled essentially with Bowtie2, Tophat2, NOIseq. Expression levels are presented as Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (RPKM). Results: We assessed expression levels of a 5 hour culture of ispG1 and compared to the parent strain CAR005. Among the 4200 predicted genes in E. coli ATCC 8739, relative expression levels for 504 genes were found changed in strain ispG1, with 166 markedly up-regulated and 338 repressed. FunCat was used to analyze the biological processes represented by these genes and found categories related to “nucleotide/nucleoside/nucleobase metabolism” (P=7.76E-05), “ribosome biogenesis,” (P=1.06E-20), “translation,” (P=4.26E-12) and “nucleobase binding” (P=1.86E-06) were markedly enriched in the repressed genes set, suggested that HMBPP accumulation might exert deterious effect on cell growth and viability. As for G4H14, only 64 genes were found down-regulated in G4H14. Biological processes associated with macromolecular synthesis no longer markedly enriched, suggesting that cell growth and viability tended to be restored to control level after eliminating HMBPP accumulation. Conclusions: Transcriptome profiling exhibited additional evidence to the cytotoxicity of HMBPP, meanwhile, demonstrated that activating downstream IspH could contribute to attenuation of such deterious effects.

RNA-Seq was used to monitor mRNA abundance and ribosome profiling was used to monitor translation initiation and UGA-Sec redefinition efficiency.
PRJNA327113,Widespread and dynamic translational control of red blood cell development,"Cell development requires tight yet dynamic control of protein production. Here, we use murine erythropoiesis as a model to study translational regulatory dynamics during mammalian cell differentiation. We uncover pervasive translational control of protein synthesis, including widespread alternative translation initiation and termination, stoichiometric synthesis, and dynamic use of upstream reading frames. We thus unravel translational regulatory programs during erythropoiesis, comprising hundreds of mRNAs with dynamic translation efficiencies and their cell type-specific regulators. A major such program involves enhanced decoding of specific mRNAs depleted in terminally differentiating/enucleating cells with decreasing transcriptional capacity. Rbm38, an erythroid-specific RNA-binding protein, promotes translation of many such genes by recruiting the translation initiation factor eIF4G. Inhibiting Rbm38 blocks red cell production, and mice lacking Rbm38 develop anemia, demonstrating an essential role for Rbm38-mediated enhanced translation of irreplaceable mRNAs. These findings reveal critical roles for dynamic translational control in supporting specialized mammalian cell formation. Overall design: Matched RNA-seq and Ribo-seq profiles of erythroid progenitors purified from E14.5 mouse fetal livers after 0, 24, 33, and 48 hours of ex vivo differentiation, generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform."
PRJNA326885,mTAIL-seq reveals dynamic poly(A) tail regulation in oocyte-to-embryo development [RNA-seq Drosophila oocyte stages],"Eukaryotic mRNAs are subject to multiple types of tailing which critically influence mRNA stability and translatability. To investigate RNA tails at the genomic scale, we previously developed TAIL-seq, but its low sensitivity precluded its application to biological materials of minute quantity. In this study, we report a new version of TAILseq (mRNA TAIL-seq or mTAIL-seq) with enhanced sequencing depth for mRNAs (by ~1000 fold compared to the previous version). The improved method allows us to investigate the regulation of poly(A) tail in Drosophila oocytes and embryos. We find that maternal mRNAs are polyadenylated mainly during late oogenesis, prior to fertilization, and that further modulation occurs upon egg activation. Wispy, a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase, adenylates the vast majority of maternal mRNAs with a few intriguing exceptions such as ribosomal protein transcripts. By comparing mTAILseq data with ribosome profiling data, we find a strong coupling between poly(A) tail length and translational efficiency during egg activation. Our data suggest that regulation of poly(A) tail in oocytes shapes the translatomic landscape of embryos, thereby directing the onset of animal development. By virtue of the high sensitivity, low cost, technical robustness, and broad accessibility, mTAIL-seq will be a potent tool to improve our understanding of mRNA tailing in diverse biological systems. Overall design: Two sets of RNA-seq on 3 developmental stages (immature oocyte, mature oocyte, and activated egg) of wild type and wispy mutant of Drosophila melanogaster."

PRJNA326506,mRNA Poly(A)-tail Changes Specified by Deadenylation Broadly Reshape Translation in Drosophila Oocytes and Early Embryos,"Because maturing oocytes and early embryos lack transcription, posttranscriptional regulatory processes must control their development.  To better understand this control, we profiled translational efficiencies and poly(A)-tail lengths throughout Drosophila oocyte maturation and early embryonic development.  The correspondence between translational-efficiency changes and tail-length changes indicated that tail-length changes broadly reshape translational activity until gastrulation, when this coupling disappears.  Relative changes were largely retained in the absence of poly(A)-tail lengthening, which indicated that selective poly(A)-tail shortening primarily specifies the changes.  Many translational changes depended on PAN GU and Smaug, and both acted primarily through tail-length changes.  Our results also revealed tail-length–independent mechanisms of translational control that repressed translation regardless of tail-length changes during oocyte maturation, maintained translation despite tail-length shortening during oocyte maturation, and prevented detectable translation of bicoid and several other mRNAs before egg activation.  In addition to these fundamental insights, our results provide valuable resources for future studies. Overall design: 42 samples analyzed using RNA-seq, ribosome footprint profiling, and PAL-seq."
PRJNA326128,hnRNP C is a key regulator of protein synthesis in mitosis,"Purpose: The goal of this study is to characterize the role of hnRNP C in translation regulation of a specific set of mRNAs during mitosis. Methods: mitotic HeLa S3 cells expressing a Dox-inducible shRNA against hnRNP C were used and profiles of total mRNAs and ribosome footprints (RFs) of either untreated (wild type) cells or hnRNP C-knockdown cells were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2500. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were aligned to a reference set of human curated protein-coding transcripts (plus the five human rRNA transcripts) using bowtie2. Expression estimates were further normalized using quantile normalization. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results: RNA-seq and Ribo/RF-seq datasets were combined according to gene ID. Only genes with expression level of at least 1.0 RPKM in both datasets were included in subsequent analyses. The combined dataset includes 10,996 genes. Transcripts encoding components of the translation machinery (Gene Ontology Biological Process [GOBP] “Translation” annotation) show reduced ribosome occupancy during mitosis under hnRNP C knockdown (p-value = 1.07 x 10-13) although their total mRNA levels are increased (p-value = 1.78 x 10-5). Translation efficiency (TE) calculations of ribosome occupancy per mRNA level showed a statistically-significant reduction for mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (Gene Ontology Cellular Compartment [GOCC] “Ribosome” annotation; p-value = 9.92 x 10-12). In particular, the TE of 5' TOP-containing mRNAs was found to be significantly reduced under hnRNP C knockdown (p-value = 5.16 x 10-4). Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of the translation effeciency of mRNAs in wild type and hnRNP C knockdown HeLa S3 cells during mitosis using RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq. Our results show that the translation of a specific subset of mRNAs (5' TOP mRNAs) is regulated by hnRNP C in mitosis. Overall design: Profiles of total mRNAs and RFs of either wild type or hnRNP C knockdown cells in mitosis were generated by deep sequencing Illumina HighSeq 2500."
PRJNA325659,"Rapid Genome-wide Recruitment of RNA Polymerase II Drives Transcription, Splicing and Translation Events during T Cell Responses","Activation of immune cells results in rapid functional changes, but how such fast changes are accomplished remains enigmatic. By combining time-courses of 4sU-Seq, RNA-Seq, ribosome profiling and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) ChIP-Seq during T cell activation, we illustrate genome-wide temporal dynamics for ~10,000 genes. This approach reveals immediate-early as well as posttranscriptionally-regulated genes, but also coupled changes in transcription and translation for >90% of genes. Recruitment, rather than release of paused RNAPII, primarily mediates transcriptional changes. This coincides with a genome-wide temporary slowdown in cotranscriptional splicing, even for polyadenylated mRNAs that are localized at the chromatin. Subsequent splicing optimization correlates with increasing Ser-2 phosphorylation of the RNAPII carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) and activation of the positive transcription elongation factor complex (pTEFb). Thus, rapid de novo recruitment of RNAPII dictates the course of events during T cell activation, in particular transcription, splicing and consequently translation.

PRJNA324409,A systematic view on Influenza induced host shut-off,"Influenza A viruses (IAV) induces drastic host shut-off during infection. We use RNA-seq and ribosome profiling to systematically look at host genes RNA and translation levels along IAV infection. We show that host shutoff is mainly achieved by reduction in cellular mRNAs levels and that the high translation levels of IAV transcripts are driven by their strong accumulation compared to host transcripts. Interestingly, our systematic analysis reveals that host transcripts are affected differently by IAV infection and the extent of cellular mRNAs reduction is strongly related to transcripts’ length and GC content. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq along IAV infection"
PRJNA324380,Ribonuclease Selection for Ribosome Profiling,"Ribosome profiling has emerged as a powerful method to assess global gene translation, but methodological and analytical challenges often lead to inconsistencies across labs and model organisms. A critical issue in ribosome profiling is nuclease treatment of ribosome-mRNA complexes, as it is important to ensure both stability of ribosomal particles and complete conversion of polysomes to monosomes. We performed comparative ribosome profiling in yeast and mice with various ribonucleases including I, A, S7 and T1, characterized their cutting preferences, trinucleotide periodicity patterns, and coverage similarities across coding sequences, and showed that they yield comparable estimations of gene expression when ribosome integrity is not compromised. However, ribosome coverage patterns of individual transcripts had little in common between the ribonucleases. We further examined their potency at converting polysomes to monosomes across other commonly used model organisms, including bacteria, nematodes and fruit flies. In some cases, ribonuclease treatment completely degraded ribosome populations. Ribonuclease T1 was the only enzyme that preserved ribosomal integrity while thoroughly converting polysomes to monosomes in all examined species. This study provides a guide for ribonuclease selection in ribosome profiling experiments across most common model systems Overall design: 8 Ribosome profiling samples (5 from yeast, 3 from mouse)"
PRJNA323858,Negative allosteric modulation of mGluR5 partially corrects pathophysiology in a mouse model of Rett Syndrome,"Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), an epigenetic regulator of mRNA transcription. Here we report a test of the hypothesis of shared pathophysiology of Rett syndrome and fragile X, another monogenic cause of autism and intellectual disability. In fragile X, the loss of the mRNA translational repressor FMRP leads to exaggerated protein synthesis downstream of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). We found that mGluR5- and protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity is similarly altered in area CA1 of Mecp2 KO mice. CA1 pyramidal cell-type-specific, genome-wide profiling of ribosome-bound mRNAs was performed in wild-type and Mecp2 KO hippocampal CA1 neurons to reveal the MeCP2-regulated 'translatome'. We found significant overlap between ribosome-bound transcripts overexpressed in the Mecp2 KO and FMRP mRNA targets. These tended to encode long genes that are functionally related to either cytoskeleton organization or the development of neuronal connectivity. In the Fmr1 KO mouse, chronic treatment with mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) has been shown to ameliorate many mutant phenotypes by correcting excessive protein synthesis. In the Mecp2 KO mice we found that mGluR5 NAM treatment significantly reduces the level of overexpressed ribosome-associated transcripts, particularly those that are also FMRP targets. Some Rett phenotypes were also ameliorated by treatment, most notably hippocampal cell size and life span. Together, these results suggest a potential mechanistic link between MeCP2-mediated transcription regulation and mGluR5/FMRP-mediated protein translation regulation through co-regulation of a subset of genes relevant to synaptic functions. Overall design: TRAP-seq analysis of the effect of negative modulator of mGluR5 on the CA1 neurons (marked by Cck-EGFP-L10a) of a mouse model of Rett syndrome"
PRJNA323510,eIF4B preferentially stimulates translation of long mRNAs with structured 5’UTRs and low closed-loop potential but weak dependence on eIF4G,"DEAD-box RNA helicases eIF4A and Ded1 promote translation by resolving mRNA secondary structures that impede preinitiation complex (PIC) attachment to mRNA or scanning. eIF4B is a cofactor for eIF4A but might also function independently of eIF4A. Ribosome profiling of mutants lacking eIF4B or with impaired eIF4A or Ded1 activity revealed that eliminating eIF4B reduces the relative translational efficiencies of many more genes than does inactivation of eIF4A, despite comparable reductions in bulk translation, and few genes display unusually strong requirements for both factors. However, either eliminating eIF4B or inactivating eIF4A preferentially impacts mRNAs with longer, more structured 5’UTRs. These findings reveal an eIF4A-independent role for eIF4B in addition to its function as eIF4A cofactor in promoting PIC attachment or scanning on structured mRNAs. eIF4B, eIF4A, and Ded1 mutations also preferentially impair translation of longer mRNAs in a fashion mitigated by the ability to form closed-loop mRNPs via eIF4F-Pab1 association, suggesting cooperation between closed-loop assembly and eIF4B/helicase functions. Remarkably, depleting eIF4G, the scaffold subunit of eIF4F, preferentially impacts short mRNAs with strong closed-loop potential and unstructured 5’UTRs, exactly the opposite features associated with hyperdependence on the eIF4B/helicases. We propose that short, highly efficient mRNAs preferentially depend on the stimulatory effects of eIF4G-dependent closed-loop assembly. Overall design: We compared the effects of mutations in eIF4B on global translational efficiencies (TEs) in yeast by ribosome footprint profiling. The study includes 16 samples, comprised of 8 mRNA-Seq samples and 8 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from biological replicates of tif3? mutant strain, and the corresponding TIF3 wild-type strain . These strains were analyzed following a temperature shift at 37°C or 15°C."
PRJNA323467,"Ribosome profiling of synchronous, non-arrested yeast cells identifies translational control of lipid biosynthesis enzymes in the cell cycle","The translational efficiency of mRNAs in cells progressing synchronously through the mitotic cell cycle and having to meet their growth requirements for cell division has not been interrogated. Here, we used ribosome profiling of a cell-size series from the time of cell birth, to identify for the first time yeast mRNAs under periodic translational control. Late in the cell cycle, there was coordinate translational activation of mRNAs encoding lipid biosynthesis enzymes. An upstream open reading frame (uORF) mediates the translational control of ACC1, the mRNA encoding the rate-limiting enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The ACC1 uORF also adjusts Acc1p protein levels in different nutrients. Mutating the ACC1 uORF delayed cell cycle progression, reduced cell size and suppressed the replicative longevity of cells lacking the Sch9p protein kinase, the yeast S6 kinase ortholog. These findings reveal unexpected links between lipogenesis and protein synthesis in mitotic cell divisions Overall design: We used centrifugal elutriation to isolate growing, highly synchronous, unbudded, early G1 cell populations and scored the elutriated cultures over time microscopically, recording the percentage of budded cells with a particle counter that directly measures their volume (channelyzer). Generation of both the Ribosome Profile (RP) and Transcriptional Profile (TP) libraries require at least =2E+09 yeast cells per sample. Such sample size could not be collected following a typical time-series experiment because only a small minority of the total cell population is in early G1 at any given moment. Instead, we allowed the entire cell population of each elutriated fraction to progress in the cell cycle until it reached a given cell size (e.g., 40 fl), at which point the sample was harvested. Elutriated cells of the same size were pooled together until enough cells per sample were obtained. This pool of same-size cells defined one experimental replicate (e.g., Sample01A). We harvested cells with 5fl cell size increments, from the time they are born (40 fl -- Sample01), until the end of the cell cycle (75 fl -- Sample08). In total we generated three independent Experimental Replicates for each cell size (A, B and C). We have: Sample01A, 01B and 01C (40 fl); Sample02A, 02B and 02C (45 fl), Sample03A, 03B and 03C (50 fl), Sample04A, 04B and 04C (55 fl), Sample05A, 05B and 05C (60 fl), Sample06A, 06B and 06C (65 fl), Sample07A, 07B and 07C (70 fl) and Sample08A, 08B and 08C (75 fl). Samples are divided into two series: Ribosome Profile (RP) and Transcriptional Profile (TP)."
PRJNA322561,Translational profiling of B cells infected with the Epstein-Barr virus reveals 5’ leader ribosome recruitment through upstream open reading frames,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome encodes several hundred transcripts. Using total RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling, we have characterized the transcriptional and translational scope of B cells infected with EBV. We could show that viral transcripts are translated at variable efficiency and that several viral genes show ribosome recruitment to the 5' leader region of mRNAs. We used two different virus strains with differing in vitro characteristics to study EBV translation and could show that in cells infected with the weakly replicating EBV strain some lytic genes showed evidence of monosomal ribosome recruitment mainly in the 5' leader region and on start codons in the absence of protein production. Finally, we could identify 25 novel upstream open reading frames that potentially regulate the translation efficiency of some viral genes. Overall design: Sample 1 experimental set-up: B cells were infected with either the B95-8 or M81 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) strain. These cells were then treated with cycloheximide for 10 min and ribosome profiles were generated that were then converted into a cDNA library for sequencing. In parallel, these cells were also treated for 2 minutes with harringtonine and again ribosome profiles were generated that were subsequently sequenced. Additionally, the total RNA was sequenced from cells infected with the B95-8 or M81 strain. Sample 2 experimental set-up: B cells were infected with either the B95-8 or M81 EBV strain. These cells were treated for 2 or 5 minutes with harringtonine and ribosome profiles were generated that were subsequently sequenced. Additionally, the total RNA from cells infected with the B95-8 or M81 strain was sequenced. HEK293 cells carrying a stably transfected B95-8 BACMID were  induced into lytic replication by transfecting a lytic cycle transactivator and these cells were then treated for 2 minutes with harringtonine. Ribosome profiling was also performed with this sample and it was subsequently sequenced."
PRJNA321727,Regulation of highly expressed hCINAP on translatome,"hCINAP is essential for human 18S rRNA processing and ribosome assembly. hCINAP is highly expressed in human cancers and promotes cancer cell growth. To connect the role of hCINAP in ribosome biogenesis and tumor growth, genome-wide polysome profiling was performed to detect the regulation of hCINAP on ribosome assembly and translation control. The results showed taht hihgly expressed hCINAP promotes ribosome biogenesis and selectively modulates cancer-associated translatome to promote malignancy. This result provides important insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the role of hCINAP in tumorigenesis. Overall design: For the transcriptional profile, MCF7 cells transfected with control vector or GFP-hCINAP were collected and total RNA was extracted. For the polysoem profile, MCF7 cells with stably expressed GFP or GFP-hCINAP were subjected to surcose gradient fractionation. Ribosome profiles were obtained by measuring the absorbance of the sucrose gradient at a wavelength of 254 nm using a BioComp Gradient Fractionator. The fractions corresponding to subpolysome and polysome were collected and RNA was extracted. The cDNA library was generated and sequenced via Illumina HiSeqTM 2000. The clean reads were mapped to the UCSC hg19 reference genome and FPKM was assigned to calculate expression levels. The recruitment to polysome of each mRNA was calculated according to their FPKM values in the monsome and polysome."

PRJNA321185,Translational contributions to tissue-specificity in rhythmic and constitutive gene expression,"BACKGROUND: The daily gene expression oscillations that underlie mammalian circadian rhythms show striking differences between tissues and involve post-transcriptional regulation. Both aspects remain poorly understood. We have used ribosome profiling to explore the contribution of translation efficiency to temporal gene expression in kidney, and contrasted our findings with liver data available from the same mice. RESULTS: Rhythmic translation of constantly abundant mRNAs affects largely nonoverlapping transcript sets with distinct phase clustering in the two organs. Moreover, tissue differences in translation efficiency modulate the timing and amount of protein biosynthesis from rhythmic mRNAs, consistent with organ-specificity in clock output gene repertoires and rhythmicity parameters. Our comprehensive datasets provided insights into translational control beyond temporal regulation. Between tissues, many transcripts show differences in translation efficiency, which are, however, of markedly smaller scale than mRNA abundance differences. Tissue-specific changes in translation efficiency are associated with specific transcript features and, intriguingly, globally counteracted and compensated transcript abundance variations, leading to higher similarity at the level of protein biosynthesis between both tissues. CONCLUSIONS: We show that tissue-specificity in rhythmic gene expression extends to the translatome and contributes to define the identities, the phases and the expression levels of rhythmic protein biosynthesis. Moreover, translational compensation of transcript abundance divergence leads to overall higher similarity at the level of protein production across organs. The unique resources provided through our study will serve to address fundamental questions of post-transcriptional control and differential gene expression in vivo. Overall design: A total of 48 mice were entrained under 12hours light:dark conditions for 2 weeks and also collected under 12hours light:dark. Mice were sacrificed every two hours during the 24 hours daily cycle. Two replicates per time point, each replicate is a pool of livers or kidneys from 2 animals."
PRJNA321151,Ribosome profiling study of Dhh1p overexpression and the dhh1 knockout strain using monosome-protected footprints,"A major determinant of mRNA half-life is the codon-dependent rate of translational elongation. How the processes of translational elongation and mRNA decay communicate is unclear. In this study we establish that the DEAD-box helicase Dhh1p is the sensor of codon optimality (i.e. translational elongation rate) that targets an mRNA for decay. First, we find that mRNAs whose translation elongation rate is slowed by inclusion of non-optimal codons are specifically degraded in a DHH1-dependent manner. Biochemical experiments show that Dhh1p is preferentially associated with mRNAs with suboptimal codon choice. We find that these effects on mRNA decay are sensitive to the number of slow moving ribosomes on an mRNA. Using a tethering system, we establish that non-optimal mRNAs become preferentially saturated with ribosomes when Dhh1p is bound. Moreover, over-expression of Dhh1p leads to the accumulation of ribosomes specifically on mRNAs with low codon optimality in ribosome profiling experiments. Lastly, Dhh1p physically interacts with ribosomes in vivo. Together, these data argue that Dhh1p is a sensor for ribosome speed, targeting an mRNA for repression and subsequent decay.  Overall design: 18 biological samples are included in the study (9 ribosome footprinting samples and 9 mRNA-Seq samples). These include wild-type, Dhh1 knockout, and Dhh1 overexpression strains (with biological replicates), as well as catalytically inactive Dhh1 overexpression. Also included are ribosome footprint profiling and mRNA-Seq of overexpression mCherry reporter mRNA with catalytically active or inactive overexpressed Dhh1 tetherered."
PRJNA321057,The RNA-binding protein TTP is a global post-transcriptional regulator of feedback control in inflammation [Ribo-seq],"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) facilitate post-transcriptional control of eukaryotic gene expression at multiple levels. The RBP tristetraprolin (TTP/Zfp36) is a signal-induced phosphorylated anti-inflammatory protein guiding unstable mRNAs of pro-inflammatory proteins for degradation and preventing translation. Using iCLIP, we have identified numerous mRNA targets bound by wild-type TTP and by a non-MK2-phosphorylatable TTP mutant (TTP-AA) in 1h LPS-stimulated macrophages and correlated their interaction with TTP to changes at the level of mRNA abundance and translation in a transcriptome-wide manner. The close similarity of the transcriptome of TTP-deficient and TTP-expressing macrophages upon short LPS stimulation suggested an effective inactivation of TTP by MK2 under these conditions whereas retained RNA-binding capacity of TTP-AA to 3’UTRs caused profound changes in the transcriptome and translatome, altered NF-?B-activation and induced cell death. Increased TTP binding to the 3''UTR of feedback inhibitor mRNAs, such as Ier3, Dusp1 or Tnfaip3, in the absence of MK2-dependent TTP neutralization resulted in a strong reduction of their protein synthesis contributing to the deregulation of the NF-?B-signaling pathway. Taken together, our study uncovers a role for TTP in NF-?B-signaling and highlights the importance of fine-tuned TTP activity-regulation by MK2 in order to control feedback signaling during the inflammatory response. Overall design: Comparison of the transcriptomes of TTP knockout macrophages inducibly expressing GFP, GFP-TTP or GFP-TTP-AA (S52A, S178A) phosphorylation mutant during 1h LPS stimulation. 3 biological replicates per genotype and condition."
PRJNA319867,Dynamics of ribosome scanning and recycling revealed by translation complex profiling,"Regulation of mRNA translation is central to eukaryotic gene expression control. Translation initiation involves binding of the 40S ribosomal small subunit (SSU) and associated initiation factors near the mRNA 5'' cap; the SSU then ‘scans’ in the 3'' direction until it detects the start codon and is joined by the 60S ribosomal large subunit (LSU) 2-5 to form the 80S ribosome (RS). Scanning and other dynamic aspects of the initiation model remain conjecture as methods to trap early intermediates are lacking. Here we uncover the dynamics of the complete translation cycle in live yeast cells using translation complex profile sequencing (TCP-Seq), a method developed from the ribosome profiling approach. We document scanning by observing SSU footprints along 5''UTRs. SSU footprint sizes and locations reveal stark conformational changes over the course of translation initiation. Further, positional information on SSUs in individual mRNAs are suggestive of cis-regulation at the level of scanning. Our approach captures ribosomal complexes at all phases of translation and will aid in studying translation dynamics in diverse cellular contexts."

Overall design: Using a Neuroepithelial cells driven medaka line expressing GFP under the control of the wdr12 promoter,( a ribosome biogenesis factor known to be expressed in Optic tectum  Neuroepithelial cells, we define the transcriptome profile of the optic tectum neuroepithelial cells, by cell-sorting followed by RNA-seq(Illumina technology) of wdr12:GFP+ and wdr12:GFP- tectal cells . The wdr12:GFP- cell population is a mix of several cell types (transitory-amplifying progenitors, post-mitotic neurons and glial cells). We used, as an additional control, the ebf3:GFP line (Mongin et al., 2011), in which post-mitotic progenitors and differentiated neurons of OT are GFP-positive in one month-old medakas."

PRJNA318054,Post-transcriptional regulation by the let-7 microRNA and the TRIM-NHL protein LIN41 [RNA-seq],"We perform RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling time course experiments to examine the effect of fully dysregulating all let-7 targets (in let-7(n2853) animals), partially dysregulating only LIN41 (in lin-41(xe11) animals) or fully dysregulating all let-7 targets while partially dysregulating LIN41 in lin-41(xe11); let-7(n2853) double mutant animals. We conclude that effects on gene expression in let-7 mutant animals are largely and quantitatively explained by dysregulation of LIN41 as its primary target. Furthermore, we identify direct LIN41 target genes regulated on the level of translation or mRNA abundance. Overall design: Total RNA-sequencing time course experiments sampling synchronized worm populations of different genetic backgrounds every two hours over the course of development from late L2/early L3 stage to late L4/Young adult stage."
PRJNA318051,A coding sequence-embedded principle governs translational reading frame fidelity,"Upon initiation at an AUG start codon, the ribosome must maintain the correct reading frame for hundreds of codons in order to produce functional proteins. Although some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3' end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. The internal mRNA:rRNA interaction not only contributes to predominant translational pausing, but also provides a post-decoding mechanism to safeguard the ribosome in the correct reading frame. Partially eliminating the AUG-like “sticky” codons in the reporter message leads to increased +1 frameshift errors. Remarkably, mutating the highly conserved CAU triplet of 18S rRNA globally changes codon “stickiness”. Further supporting the role of “sticky” sequences in reading frame maintenance, the codon composition of open reading frames is highly optimized across eukaryotic genomes by minimizing the appearance of AUG-like codons in the frame 2. These results suggest an important layer of information embedded within the protein coding sequences that instructs the ribosome to ensure reading frame fidelity during translation. Overall design: Investigating the role of 18S rRNA in controlling translational reading frame fidelity"

PRJNA317266,MYC dependent mRNA translation shapes gene expression and cell biology,"We report that MYC controls the translation of specific mRNAs in a sequence and RNA binding protein dependent manner. Specifically, using transcriptome-scale ribosome footprinting we identify 882 mRNAs whose translation depends on MYC. These mRNAs are highly significantly enriched for specific 5ÕUTR sequence motifs that bind the SRSF1/RBM42/HNRNPK complex. For example, MYC and SRFSF1/RBM42 dependent transcripts include many components of the electron transport chain and directly affect cellular respiration. Our results provide an integrated map of MYC driven gene expression programs that includes MYCÕs ability to control mRNA translation. Overall design: Human B-cell lymphoma P493 cells were treated with Tetracycline (0.1 uM) for 24 hrs followed by cycloheximide treatment for 10 minutes in triplicates. An aliquot of cells were used for total RNA preparation and remaining cells were processed for isolation of ribosome protected fragments."
PRJNA316618,Regulation of poly(A) tail and translation during the somatic cell cycle,"Poly(A) tails are critical for mRNA stability and translation. However, recent studies have challenged this view, showing that poly(A) tail length and translation efficiency are decoupled in non-embryonic cells. Using TAIL-seq and ribosome profiling, we investigate poly(A) tail dynamics and translational control in the somatic cell cycle. We find dramatic changes in poly(A) tail lengths of cell cycle regulatory genes like CDK1, TOP2A, and FBXO5, explaining their translational repression in M phase. We also find that poly(A) tail length is coupled to translation when the poly(A) tail is <20 nucleotides. However, as most genes have >20 nucleotide poly(A) tails, their translation is regulated mainly via poly(A) tail length-independent mechanisms during the cell cycle. Specifically, we find that terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) tract-containing transcripts escape global translational suppression in M phase and are actively translated. Our quantitative and comprehensive data provide a revised view of translational control in the somatic cell cycle. Overall design: HeLa cells were synchronized at S or M phase, and subject to RNA-seq, ribosome profiling and TAIL-seq analysis."
PRJNA316606,RISC-mediated control of selected chromatin regulators stabilizes ground state pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (TRAP),"We performed an integrated analysis of RNA and proteins at the transition between naïve ES cells and cells primed to differentiate. During this transition, mRNAs coding for chromatin regulators were specifically released from translational inhibition mediated by RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). This suggests that, prior to differentiation, the propensity of ES cells to change their epigenetic status is hampered by RNA interference. The expression of these chromatin regulators was reinstated following acute inactivation of RISC, and it correlated with loss of stemness markers and activation of early cell differentiation markers in treated ES cells. Overall design: We evaluated ribosome occupancy of mRNAs in embryonic stem cells and Epiblast-Like Aggregates by means of polysome profiling with a modified Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification protocol (TRAP)."

PRJNA316463,Ubiquitination of Stalled Ribosome Triggers Ribosome-associated Quality Control [SET1],"Translation elongation rates are regulated to ensure proper conformation and biological function of proteins. Translation of either non-stop mRNA or transcripts coding for poly-basic sequences induces ribosome stalling, and the arrest product is degraded by the ribosome-mediated quality control system (RQC). During this process, the stalled ribosome is dissociated into subunits, and the polypeptide is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin on the 60S large ribosomal subunit (LSU) leading to subsequent proteasomal degradation. However, it is largely unknown how stalled ribosomes are recognized and dissociated into subunits. Here we report that ubiquitination of the ribosomal protein uS10 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hel2 is required for the production of the RQC substrate. RQC-trigger (RQT) factors, a RNA helicase-family protein Slh1/Rqt2, ubiquitin binding protein Cue3/Rqt3 and yKR023W/Rqt4, were also required for the primary steps of RQC, and associated with Hel2-ribosome complexes. Rqt2-4 factors were dispensable for the ubiquitination of uS10 by Hel2/Rqt1 and associated with ribosomes independent of the ubiquitination of uS10. However, the ubiquitin-binding activity of Rqt3 were crucial to trigger RQC. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis revealed that Hel2 bound ribosomes are in an rotated state containing hybrid state AP- and PE-tRNAs. Furthermore, ribosome profiling revealed that short footprints, hallmarks of hybrid state ribosomes18, were accumulated at tandem CGA rare codons at the beginning of the poly arginine stalling sequence and long footprints at subsequent codons, respectively. Short footprints at CGA codons were decreased in rqt1 mutant but drastically increased in uS10 mutants defective in the ubiquitination or rqt2 mutant. Collectively, our results demonstrate   that Hel2 stabilizes ratcheted ribosomes leading to ubiquitination of uS10. Subsequently, Rqt2-4 factors target these hybrid state ribosomes specifically, allowing subsequent RQC reactions. Overall design: Ribosome,profiling"

PRJNA316065,Ribosome profiling-guided depletion of an mRNA improves CHO cell growth and recombinant product titers,"We present the first comprehensive genome-wide view of CHO translational activity during recombinant expression by the application of ribosome profiling. The distribution of translational power in CHO cells was analyzed in the context of the recombinant mRNAs and the endogenous mRNA pool. In an antibody-producing CHO cell line, the recombinant mRNAs were found to be the most abundant transcripts and also sequestered a substantial amount of translating ribosomes (up to 15%). The recombinant mRNAs were translated as efficiently as the endogenous mRNAs, and changes in translation and transcription of the recombinant mRNAs were directly reflected in changes in specific productivity. Interestingly, improvements in bioprocess quality attributes were achieved by depleting the highly expressed and translated inert NeoR mRNA by siRNA-mediated knock-down. This resulted in improved cellular growth, which was accompanied by an 18% increase in antibody titers. This study is the first to carefully map the translatome of the CHO cell to the nucleotide level and to demonstrate how recombinant expression affects the cell on the translational level. Overall design: Examine translation of IgG at exponential phase (day3) and stationary phase (day6) in CHO cell"
PRJNA316045,Arabidopsis thaliana Raw sequence reads,"High-throughput approaches for profiling the 5'' ends of RNA degradation intermediates on a genome-wide scale are frequently applied in the validation of cleavage sites guided by microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the complexity of the RNA degradome beyond miRNA targets currently is largely unclear which limits the application of degradome. We provide multiple lines of evidence to show that ribosome footprints are widespread in the plant degradome. A 3-nt periodicity and a bias toward the translational frame were observed in the analysis of 5' truncated mRNA ends mapped to the coding sequence (CDS). In addition, predominant 5' termini of RNA degradation intermediates separated by a length equal to a ribosome-protected fragment were evident in the conserved peptide upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Through the analysis of degradome data, we uncovered novel ribosome stalling uORFs including a lineage specific uORF in the Brassicaceae family. Phased degradation signatures of stacked ribosomes were also identified in the CDS of multiple genes. Furthermore, we show that the binding of ARGONAUTE7 to a non-cleavable target site of miR390 might directly hinder ribosome movement. This work shows that the RNA degradome contains in vivo ribosome-protected mRNA fragments and demonstrates an alternative use of degradome data in the study of ribosome stalling."
PRJNA315830,The dynamic translatome of retinal ganglion cell axons during assembly and maintenance of the mouse visual system,"Local mRNA translation mediates the adaptive responses of axons to extrinsic signals but direct evidence that it occurs in mammalian CNS axons in vivo is scant. We developed an axon-TRAP-RiboTag approach in mouse that allows deep-sequencing analysis of ribosome-bound mRNAs in the retinal ganglion cell axons of the developing and adult retinotectal projection in vivo. The embryonic-to-postnatal axonal translatome comprises an evolving subset of enriched genes with axon-specific roles suggesting distinct steps in axon wiring, such as elongation, pruning and synaptogenesis. Adult axons, remarkably, have a complex translatome with strong links to axon survival, neurotransmission and neurodegenerative disease. Translationally co-regulated mRNA subsets share common upstream regulators, and novel sequence elements generated by alternative splicing that promote axonal mRNA translation. Our results indicate that intricate regulation of compartment-specific mRNA translation in mammalian CNS axons supports the formation and maintenance of neural circuits in vivo. Overall design: The profiling of ribosome-bound mRNAs in mouse retinal ganglion cell axons at 4 different developmental stages"
PRJNA315441,Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development at bulk and single-cell levels,"Purpose: Exploring mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the brain . Methods: High-resolution gene expression profiles of embryonic endothelial cells (EC) using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and single cell RNA-sequencing. RNA-sequenzing of transcription factor infected HUVEC. Results: Comparisons of different organ-, temporal- or Ctnnb1 knock out-specific vascular translatomes revealed extensive molecular changes during the unique development of the brain endothelium. We identified brain endothelial-specific transcription factors – Foxf2, Foxl2, Foxq1, Lef1, Ppard, Zfp551 and Zic3 – that are associated with the temporal maturation of the blood-brain barrier and act downstream of the Wnt/Ctnnb1 signaling pathway. Profiling individual EC revealed a remarkable heterogeneity. Nevertheless, high levels of Foxf2, Foxq1, Ppard and Zic3 were correlated with elevated expression of differentiation markers. This could be recapitulated in vitro, where expression of Foxf2 and Zic3 in HUVEC led to an induction of blood-brain barrier differentiation markers. Conclusions: Our study provides further insights into the temporal and cellular complexity of the developing embryonic brain endothelium. Our data raises many questions and provides a basis for further studies aiming to unravel cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie vascular development and differentiation in the CNS. We anticipate that additional investigation of the identified transcription factors is likely to be a fruitful approach in understanding and manipulating the development of BBB and to engineer more advanced blood brain barrier in vitro models. Overall design: TRAP-seq profiles for E11.5 till E17.5 wild type (WT) brain EC; E14.5 and E17.5 endothelial Ctnnb1 -/- brain EC; E14.5 head, heart, kidney, limb, liver and lung WT EC in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

Because the molecular pathology is highly complex and the etiology poorly understood we employed a defined human neuronal model with a single mTOR activating mutation to dissect the disease-relevant molecular responses driving the neuropathology. TSC2 deficient neural stem cells showed severely reduced neuronal functional maturation and characteristics of astrogliosis instead. Accordingly, transcriptome analysis uncovered an inflammatory response and increased metabolic activity, while ribosome profiling revealed excessive translation of ribosomal transcripts and higher synthesis rates of angiogenic growth factors.

PRJNA314019,Genome-wide profiling of mTOR-dependent translation in Oikopleura dioica,"Protein synthesis is an energy-demanding process essential for cell proliferation and survival. Balancing the cost of protein synthesis with available resources has driven the evolution of its nutrient-dependent regulation. A central mechanism in this regulation is the repression of translation of the protein synthesis machinery during unfavorable growth conditions. This is mediated via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a master regulator of growth conserved from yeast to human. Despite extensive research, and the elucidation of a number of important factors, how mRNAs are translationally regulated by mTOR is still unclear. Repression depends on a 5' Terminal Oligo Pyrimidine (TOP) motif which is conserved across vertebrates and present in Drosophila melanogaster. In Caenorhabditis elegans and the marine chordate Oikopleura dioica most TOP mRNAs are trans-spliced to a spliced leader. This results in the removal of the originally transcribed 5' end and its replacement with a common short RNA sequence. In both species the 5' end of the spliced leader is pyrimidine-enriched but does not meet strict requirements for a canonical TOP motif. How this affects the translational control of TOP mRNAs is unknown. Here, using transcriptome-wide ribosome profiling on whole animals treated with the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, we show that trans-spliced TOP mRNAs in O. dioica are subject to mTOR-dependent translational control. We also show, using existing data, that trans-spliced transcripts in C. elegans are differentially translated upon recovery from starvation-induced developmental diapause. Together our results demonstrate that spliced leaders in metazoans are targets for mTOR-dependent translational control in response to nutrient availability. This indicates that trans-splicing in metazoans, the function of which has remained largely enigmatic, plays a key role in the coordinated translational regulation of growth-related genes. Moreover, our results reveal an innovative strategy for rapid evolution and developmental control of downstream targets of the ancient mTOR pathway. Overall design: Ribosome-protected RNA fragments and total RNA extracted from animals treated with mTOR inhibitor Torin 1 and control animals (DMSO) in three biological replicates (12 samples in total) sequenced on two lanes on each of two Illumina flow cells"
PRJNA312799,Ligation-Free Ribosome Profiling Reveals Cell Type-Specific Regulation of Protein Synthesis in the Brain,"Ribosome profiling has emerged as a powerful tool for genome-wide measurements of translation, but library construction requires multiple ligation steps and remains cumbersome relative to more conventional deep sequencing experiments. We report a new approach to ribosome profiling that does not require ligation. Library construction for ligation-free ribosome profiling can be completed in one day with as little as 1 ng of purified RNA footprints. We used ligation-free ribosome profiling to identify new patterns of cell type-specific translation in the brain and tested its ability to identify translational targets of mTOR signaling in the brain. Overall design: We report a strategy for ligation free cell-type specific ribosome profiling. Our strategy was utilized to explore cell-type specific expression in mouse brain."

PRJNA311315,Translational profiling of retinal ganglion cell optic nerve regeneration in Xenopus laevis,"Unlike adult mammals, adult frogs regrow and regenerate their optic nerve following a crush injury. Using Translational Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP), a method to isolate mRNAs actively undergoing translation in a target cell population, we have generated a transcriptional profile by RNA-Seq for retinal ganglion cells (RGC) during the period of recovery following an optic nerve injury.  Based on bioinformatics analysis using the JGI 9.1 Xenopus laevis gene models, our results reveal a profound shift in the composition of actively translating mRNAs during the early stages of RGC regeneration: as factors involved in cell signaling are rapidly downregulated, and those involved in core metabolism are upregulated.  We identified one highly upregulated gene in response to injury, uchl1, which coupled to downregulation of the synucleins (snca, scng), was previously implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.  Our injury-screen in Xenopus identified a previously unknown gene, gng8, as being associated with the regenerative process.  Our generated online database provides the Xenopus community a valuable resource for the identification of genes involved in the regeneration process to target for future functional studies. Overall design: To investigate the changes in gene expression that occur as retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) recover and regrow following injury, we have used the TRAP method.  With TRAP we are able to isolate the actively translating pool of mRNAs from a specific cell type, in this case RGCs.  To do this, we created lines of transgenic frogs which express an eGFP-tagged variant of the large ribosomal protein rpl10a under the control of an RGC-specific promoter from the islet2b locus.  In our experimental framework, we quantify gene expression changes in RGCs recovering from optic nerve crush by comparing mRNA levels in samples collected from the eye undergoing a surgical crush (right) to the contralateral eye (left).  At discrete time points following optic nerve crush in the left eye, both eyes are rapidly dissected and the ribosome-associated RNAs purified from tissue extracts using eGFP antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads.  To control for the effects of surgery on RGCs, gene expression was also quantified in animals that underwent sham surgeries with no optic nerve crush (sham samples).  To control for the systemic effects of the surgical procedure per se, gene expression was also quantified in animals that did not undergo any surgery (naive sample).  These mRNA pools were used to construct libraries for RNA-Seq using poly(A) selection and 2x multiplexing."

PRJNA311041,Operon mRNAs are organized into ORF-centric structures that predict translation efficiency,"Bacterial mRNAs are organized into operons consisting of discrete open reading frames (ORFs) in a single polycistronic mRNA. Individual ORFs on the mRNA are differentially translated, with rates varying as much as 100-fold. The signals controlling differential translation are poorly understood. Our genome-wide mRNA secondary structure analysis indicated that operonic mRNAs are comprised of ORF-wide units of secondary structure that vary across ORF boundaries such that adjacent ORFs on the same mRNA molecule are structurally distinct. ORF translation rate is strongly correlated with its mRNA structure in vivo, and correlation persists, albeit in a reduced form, with its structure when translation is inhibited and with that of in vitro refolded mRNA. These data suggests that intrinsic ORF mRNA structure encodes a rough blueprint for translation efficiency. This structure is then amplified by translation, in a self-reinforcing loop, to provide the structure that ultimately specifies the translation of each ORF. Overall design: mRNA-seq and ribosome profiling of E. coli MG1655 (wild-type) cells at 37°C and DMS-seq of in vivo modified mRNA from wild-type cells, kasugamycin-treated or untreated ?gcvB cells, as well as in vitro modified mRNA refolded at 37°C or denatured at 95°C.

PRJNA310776,Global analysis of truncated RNA ends reveals novel insights into ribosome stalling in plants,"High-throughput approaches for profiling the 5'' ends of RNA degradation intermediates on a genome-wide scale are frequently applied in the validation of cleavage sites guided by microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the complexity of the RNA degradome beyond miRNA targets is currently largely unclear which limits the application of RNA degradome. Here, we provide multiple lines of evidence to show that the plant RNA degradome contains in vivo ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. We observed a 3-nt periodicity and a bias toward the translational frame in the global analysis of 5'' truncated mRNA ends mapped to the coding sequence (CDS) of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and soybean (Glycine max). In addition, predominant 5'' termini of RNA degradation intermediates separated by a length equal to a ribosome-protected mRNA fragment were evident in some conserved peptide upstream open reading frames (uORFs) of Arabidopsis and rice. Through the analysis of RNA degradome data, we uncovered novel uORFs and CDS regions potentially associated with stacked ribosomes in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the analysis of RNA degradome data suggested that the binding of Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE7 to a non-cleavable target site of miR390 might directly hinder ribosome movement. This work demonstrates an alternative use of RNA degradome data in the study of ribosome stalling. Overall design: Profiling 5'' ends of RNA degradation intermediate in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings and inflorescences by parallel analysis  of RNA ends (PARE)"

PRJNA309403,Nucleotide resolution analysis reveals extensive regulation of translation in response to neural depolarization.,"Studies on regulation of gene expression have contributed substantially to understanding mechanisms for long term alterations in neural connectivity in response to activity. Most of these, however, focused on the regulation of mRNA transcription. Here, we utilized high-throughput sequencing coupled with ribosomal footprinting to globally characterize the regulation of translation in neural cells in response to depolarization-mediated neural activity. We identify substantial and complex regulation of translation, with hundreds of transcripts demonstrating changes in ribosome occupancy independent of transcriptional changes. These changes are partially mediated by features in the sequence —notably uAUGs and secondary structure in the 5'UTR— both of which predict downregulation in response to activity. These transcripts are also disproportionately targets of Fmrp and include genes implicated in autism in humans.  Our findings indicate that in neurons activity plays a critical role in regulating mRNA translation across the genome and suggest dysregulation of the process may contribute to disease. Overall design: 3 replicates were prepared for both  Kcl-stimulated and unstimulated neuronal cultures from P0 FVB mouse cortices."
PRJNA309302,nanoCAGE reveals 5’ UTR features that define specific modes of translation of functionally related mTOR-sensitive mRNAs,"mTOR regulates mRNA translation. Whereas ribosome-profiling suggested that mTOR exclusively stimulates translation of TOP (containing a 5’-terminal oligopyrimidine [5’TOP] motif) and TOP-like mRNAs, polysome-profiling implied that mTOR also modulates translation of non-TOP mRNAs. We show that ribosome-, but not polysome-profiling, is biased towards identification of TOP mRNAs as differentially translated while obscuring detection of changes in non-TOP mRNA translation. Transcription start site profiling by Nano-Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (nanoCAGE) revealed that many mTOR-sensitive mRNAs do not have 5’TOP motifs. Moreover, nanoCAGE showed that 5’ UTR features distinguish two functionally and translationally distinct subsets of mTOR-sensitive mRNAs: i) those with short 5’ UTRs enriched for mitochondrial functions such as respiration, that are translated in an eIF4E, but not eIF4A1-dependent manner and ii) mRNAs encoding proliferation- and survival-promoting proteins, that harbor long 5’ UTRs, and require both eIF4E and eIF4A1 for their efficient translation. Selective inhibition of translation of mRNAs harboring long 5’ UTRs via suppression of eIF4A leads to uncoupling of expression of proteins involved in respiration (e.g. ATP5O) from those protecting mitochondrial integrity (e.g. BCL-2) ultimately resulting in apoptosis. Conversely, simultaneous translational downregulation of both long and short 5’ UTR mRNAs by mTOR inhibitors results in suppression of mitochondrial respiration and predominantly cytostatic effects.  Therefore, 5’ UTR features define differential modes of translation of functionally distinct mTOR-sensitive mRNAs, which explains discrepancies between the effects of mTOR and eIF4A inhibitors on neoplastic cells.

PRJEB6709,MeDIP-seq of pig induced pluripotent stem cells,"The wide application of pig disease model has caused a surge of interest in the study of derivation of pig induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs). Here we performed genome-wide analysis of gene expression profiling by RNA-seq and small RNA-seq and DNA methylation profile by MeDIP-seq in pig iPSCs through comparison with somatic cells. We identified mRNA and microRNA transcripts that were specifically expressed in pig iPSCs. We then pursued comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, including functional annotation of the generated data within the context of biological pathways, to uncover novel biological functions associated with maintenance of pluripotency in pig. This result supports that pig iPS have transcript profiles linked to ribosome, chromatin remodeling, and genes involved in cell cycle that may be critical to maintain their pluripotency, plasticity, and stem cell function. Our analysis demonstrates the key role of RNA splicing in regulating the pluripotency phenotype of pig cells. Specifically, the data indicate distinctive expression patterns for SALL4 spliced variants in different pig cell types and highlight the necessity of defining the type of SALL4 when addressing the expression of this gene in pig cells. MeDIP-seq data revealed that the distribution patterns of methylation signals in pig iPS and somatic cells along the genome. We identify 25 novel porcine miRNA, including pluripotency-related miR-302/367cluster up-regulated in pig iPSCs. At last, we profile the dynamic gene expression signature of pluripotent genes in the preimplantation development embryo of pig. The resulting comprehensive data allowed us to compare various different subsets of pig pluripotent cell. This information provided by our analysis will ultimately advance the efforts at generating stable naive pluripotency in pig cells."
PRJNA307191,Profiling of 2'-O-Me in human rRNA reveals a subset of fractionally modified positions and provides evidence for ribosome heterogeneity,"Ribose methylation is one of the two most abundant modifications in human ribosomal RNA and is believed to be important for ribosome biogenesis, mRNA selectivity and translational fidelity. We have applied RiboMeth-seq to rRNA from HeLa cells for ribosome-wide, quantitative mapping of 2'-O-Me sites and obtained a comprehensive set of 106 sites, including two novel sites, and with plausible box C/D guide RNAs assigned to all but three sites. We find approximately two-thirds of the sites to be fully methylated and the remainder to be fractionally modified in support of ribosome heterogeneity at the level of RNA modifications. A comparison to HCT116 cells reveals similar 2'-O-Me profiles with distinct differences at several sites. This constitutes the first comprehensive mapping of 2'-O-Me sites in human rRNA using a high throughput sequencing approach and paves the way for experimental analyses of the role of variations in rRNA methylation under different physiological or pathological settings. Overall design: HTC116 and HeLa cells were subjected to RiboMeth-seq analysis. 3 barcoded sequencing adapters were used to produce 3 individual libraries from HTC116 RNA sequenced on 1 individual Ion Proton sequencing chip, and 3 x 2 individual libraries from HeLa RNA sequenced on 2 individual Ion Proton sequencing chips. The 3 gzip compressed fastq files from the sequencings, and the 3 final spread-sheets with annotated data are available here."

PRJNA306259,Redefining the translational status of 80S monosomes,"Fully assembled ribosomes exist in two populations: polysomes and monosomes. While the former has been studied extensively, to what extent translation occurs on monosomes and its importance for overall translational output remains controversial. Here, we used ribosome profiling to examine the translational status of 80S monosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the vast majority of 80S monosomes are elongating, not initiating. Further, most mRNAs exhibit some degree of monosome occupancy, with monosomes predominating on nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) targets, upstream open reading frames (uORFs), canonical ORFs shorter than ~590 nucleotides and ORFs for which the total time required to complete elongation is substantially shorter than that required for initiation. Importantly, mRNAs encoding low-abundance regulatory proteins tend to be enriched in the monosome fraction. Our data highlight the importance of monosomes for the translation of highly regulated mRNAs.  Overall design: We examined the translational status of single 80S ribosomes using ribosome profiling, and compared these monosome footprints to both polysome ribosome footprints and general ribosome profiling.  RNASeq libraries were also prepared from the overall sample input."
PRJNA305807,SPECtre: a spectral coherence-based classifier of actively translated transcripts from ribosome profiling sequence data,"Active protein translation can be assessed and measured using ribosome profiling sequencing strategies. Existing approaches make use of sequence fragment length or frame occupancy to differentiate between active translation and background noise, however they do not consider additional characteristics inherent to the technology which limits their overall accuracy. Here, we present an analytical tool that models the overall tri-nucleotide periodicity of ribosomal occupancy using a classifier based on spectral coherence. Our software, SPECtre, examines the relationship of normalized ribosome profiling read coverage over a rolling series of windows along a transcript against an idealized reference signal. A comparison of SPECtre against current methods on existing and new data shows a marked improvement in accuracy for detecting active translation and exhibits overall high sensitivity at a low false discovery rate. Overall design: Classification of actively translated transcripts in ribosome profiling data derived from human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, and data previously published derived from mouse embryonic stem cells and zebrafish embryos."
PRJNA305643,Improved ribosome-footprint and mRNA measurements provide insights into dynamics and regulation of yeast translation,"Ribosome-footprint profiling provides genome-wide snapshots of translation, but technical challenges can confound its analysis. Here, we use improved methods to obtain ribosome-footprint profiles and mRNA abundances that more faithfully reflect gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results support proposals that both the beginning of coding regions and codons matching rare tRNAs are more slowly translated. They also indicate that emergent polypeptides with as few as three basic residues within a 10-residue window tend to slow translation. With the improved mRNA measurements, the variation attributable to translational control in exponentially growing yeast was less than previously reported, and most of this variation could be predicted with a simple model that considered mRNA abundance, upstream open reading frames, cap-proximal structure and nucleotide composition, and lengths of the coding and 5'-untranslated regions. Collectively, our results provide a framework for executing and interpreting ribosome-profiling studies and reveal key features of translational control in yeast. Overall design: Ribosome-footprint profiling and RNA-seq (total RNA, poly(A) selected, RiboMinus treated, or Ribo-Zero treated) from log-phase S. cerevisiae. The study includes a reanalysis of the two Samples from GSE53313. The reanalyzed data is linked to the Series record."
PRJNA305418,"RiboZero mRNA-seq across zebrafish development, for study of uORFs","Untranslated mRNA regions(UTRs) are key mediators of post-transcriptional regulation. Previous studies have predicted thousands of ORFs in 5''UTRs, the vast majority of which have unknown function. We present a systematic analysis of the translation and function of upstream open reading frames(uORFs) across vertebrates. Combining high-resolution ribosome footprinting and phasing, we find that i) uORFs are pervasive within vertebrate transcriptomes, ii) the majority show signatures of active translation, and iii) uORFs act as potent regulators of translation and RNA levels, with a similar magnitude to miRNAs. Evolution has targeted sequence features to mitigate the effects of constitutively repressive uORFs. Finally, we observe that the regulatory potential of uORFs on individual genes is conserved across species. These results provide insight into the regulatory code within mRNA leader sequences and their capacity to modulate translation across vertebrates.The mRNA-seq data contained in this archive were used along with ribosome profiling data to calculate translation efficiency values."
PRJNA303958,Thousands of novel translated open reading frames in humans inferred by ribosome footprint profiling.,"Accurate annotations of protein coding regions are essential for understanding how genetic information is translated into biological functions. The recent development of ribosome footprint profiling provides an important new tool for measuring translation. Here we describe riboHMM, a new method that uses ribosome footprint data along with gene expression and sequence information to accurately infer translated sequences. We applied our method to human lymphoblastoid cell lines and identified 7,863 previously unannotated coding sequences, including 445 translated sequences in pseudogenes and 2,442 translated upstream open reading frames. We observed an enrichment of harringtonine-treated ribosome footprints at the inferred initiation sites, validating many of the novel coding sequences. In aggregate, the novel sequences exhibit significant signatures of purifying selection indicative of protein-coding function, suggesting that many of the novel sequences are functional. We observed that nearly 40% of bicistronic transcripts showed significant negative correlation in the levels of translation of their two coding sequences, suggesting a key regulatory role for these novel translated sequences. Despite evidence for their functional importance, the novel peptide sequences were detected by mass spectrometry at a lower rate than predicted based on data from annotated proteins, thus suggesting that many of the novel peptide products may be relatively short-lived. Our work illustrates the value of ribosome profiling for improving coding annotations, and significantly expands the set of known coding regions. Overall design: Ribosome profiling assays were performed on cell lines treated with Harringtonine to generate data for validating translation initiatoin site prediction"
PRJNA303186,Accurate prediction of cellular co-translational folding indicates proteins can switch from post- to co-translational folding,"The rates at which domains fold and codons are translated are important factors in determining whether a nascent protein will co-translationally fold and function or misfold and malfunction. In this study, we develop a chemical kinetic model that calculates a protein domain’s co-translational folding curve using only the domain’s bulk folding and unfolding rates and codon translation rates. We show that this model accurately predicts the course of co-translational folding measured in vivo for four different protein molecules. As part of our chemical kinetic model, we assume that there is steady-state translation kinetics through the time-course of the experiment. To prove that this assumption is valid, we performed Ribo-Seq experiments on two biological replicates of yeast cells to compare their ribosome profiles. For genes with sufficient coverage across the open reading frames in both the replicates, we compare the ribosome profiles from both replicates and see a strong correlation. This implies there is a steady-state and our assumption is valid. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of two biological replicates of S288C yeast cells"
PRJNA302167,Translation elongation mediated quality control of integral membrane protein synthesis,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been engineered to utilize cellobiose, which are prevalent in plant cell wall, by introducing a cellodextrin transporter gene (cdt-1) and an intracellular ß-glucosidase gene (codon-optimized gh1-1) from Neurospora crassa. We previously found that codon-optimization of GH1-1 improved fermentation rates under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. However, we found that the codon-optimized version of the CDT-1 transporter (here denoted OPT for the mRNA) resulted in reduced cellobiose uptake and slower growth in cellobiose by S. cerevisiae relative to the transporter with Neurospora-derived coding sequence (hereafter NC for the mRNA). We performed ribosome profiling and RNA deep sequencing of cells expressing NC and OPT grown at mid-exponential phases, respectively. Differences in ribosome occupancy on NC and OPT transcripts suggested increased rates of translation elongation of the N-terminal sequence of OPT in contrast to NC, which may be responsible for the slow-growth phenotype of cells expressing OPT. Overall design: Examine ribosome footprints and mRNA abundance in biological replicates of S. cerevisiae strains expressing a cellodextrin transporter gene (cdt-1) and the codon-optimized version of cdt-1, respecitively"
PRJNA301561,Mycoplasma gallisepticum S6 Translatome profiling,Mycoplasma gallisepticum as well as other species of the Mollicutes class feature significantly reduced genome. Previously we identified that the heat stress results in drastic changes of the transcription profile but these changes are poorly reflected on the protein level. Here we used RNA-seq strategy for sequencing mRNAs associated with ribosomes under the normal and the heat stress conditions to study genetic information transfer from RNA to protein in M. gallisepticum. We observed significant upregulation of the small CDSs. Substantial part of the small CDSs is more controlled by terminators of the previous CDSs rather than promoters. Among mRNAs with known function we observed 10-fold upregulation of mRNA coding for homologs of the immunoglobulin-blocking protein M from M. genitalium and also DCW (Division Cell Wall) cluster mRNA. Downregulated transcripts are enriched in mRNAs coding for the ribosomal proteins. Investigation of secondary structure in the upstream region of mRNA showed a weak influence stability of the secondary structure to mRNA abundance in the ribosome-bound fraction. Our results can reveal mechanisms that control binding of mRNAs to ribosomes under the normal and the stress conditions.
PRJNA301347,Translational profiling identifies a cascade of damage initiated in motor neurons and spreading to glia in mutant SOD1-mediated ALS,"Ubiquitous expression of ALS-causing mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) provoke non-cell autonomous paralytic disease. By combining ribosome affinity purification and high-throughput sequencing, a cascade of mutant SOD1-dependent, cell type-specific changes are now identified. Initial mutant-dependent damage is restricted to motor neurons and includes synapse and metabolic abnormalities, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and selective activation of the PERK arm of the unfolded protein response. PERK activation correlates with what we identify to be a naturally low level of ER chaperones in motor neurons. Early changes in astrocytes are to genes involved in inflammation and metabolism and that are targets of the PPAR and LXR transcription factors. Dysregulation of myelination and lipid signaling pathways and activation of ETS transcription factors occur in oligodendrocytes only after disease initiation. Thus, pathogenesis involves a temporal cascade of cell type selective damage initiating in motor neurons, with subsequent damage within glia driving disease propagation. Overall design: Cell type-specific mRNA was purified by ribosome affinity purification from the spinal cord of bacTRAP reporter mice that label selective cell types by EGFP-tagged ribosome RPL10A. Sequencing libraries were prepared from 3-6 biological replicates for each genotype to determine the mutant induced gene expression changes in specific cell types."
PRJNA301154,A dynamic unfolded protein response contributes to the control of cortical neurogenesis,"The cerebral cortex contains layers of neurons sequentially generated by distinct lineage-related progenitors. At the onset of corticogenesis, the first-born progenitors are apical progenitors (APs) whose asymmetric division give birth directly to neurons. Later, they switch to indirect neurogenesis by generating intermediate progenitors (IPs), which give rise to projection neurons of all cortical layers. While a direct lineage relationship between APs and IPs has been established, the molecular mechanism that controls their transition remains elusive. Our data suggest that interfering with codon translation speed triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR), further impairing the generation of IPs and leading to microcephaly. Moreover, we demonstrate that a progressive downregulation of UPR in cortical progenitors acts as physiological signal to amplify IPs and promotes indirect neurogenesis. Thus, our findings reveal a hitherto unrecognized contribution of UPR to cell fate acquisition during mammalian brain development. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq of forebrains from E14.5 mouse embryos from wild type animals and mutants carrying a conditional knockout of ELP3 in cortical progenitors"
PRJNA300669,Biogenesis and function of tRNA fragments during sperm maturation and fertilization in mammals,"Parental dietary conditions can influence the metabolic traits of offspring. In mice, paternal consumption of low protein diet alters cholesterol and lipid metabolism of progeny. Here, we examine RNA species expressed in male reproductive tissues of mice. Protein restriction leads to altered levels of multiple small RNAs in mature sperm, as well as throughout the male reproductive tract, with decreased levels of let-7 family members and increased levels of 5’ fragments of tRNA-Gly isoacceptors. Intriguingly, tRNA fragments are scarce in the testis, but their levels increase in sperm during posttesticular maturation in the epididymis. We find that epididymosomes – extracellular vesicles which fuse with sperm during epididymal transit – exhibit RNA payloads closely matching those of mature sperm, and can deliver tRNA fragments to immature sperm in vitro both in mouse and in bull. Finally, we show that tRNA-Gly-GCC fragments play a role in repressing genes associated with the endogenous retroelement MERVL, both in ES cells and in preimplantation embryos. Our results shed light on small RNA biogenesis during post-testicular sperm maturation, and link tRNA fragments to regulation of endogenous retroelements active in the early embryo. Overall design: E14 mESCs  were transfected with LNA-containing oligos antisense to tRF-GG or GFP-esiRNA as control, then either total RNA was isolated or 80S ribosomes were isolated from Rnase-digested whole cell lysate, and footprints between 26-32nt were collected for ribosome profiling library construction using a kit-free protocol based on Heyer et al. 2015 NAR."

PRJNA300274,Cotranslational signal independent SRP preloading during membrane targeting,"Cotranslational targeting into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) is a key event determining polypeptide fate in eukaryotic cells. Here, we globally define the principles and mechanisms of SRP binding and ER targeting in vivo. Cotranslational targeting through SRP is the dominant route into the ER for all secretory proteins, regardless of targeting signal characteristics. Cytosolic SRP functions in a pioneer translation round that builds a membrane-resident mRNAs pool, explaining how low SRP levels suffice for the secretory load. SRP does not induce an elongation arrest; consequently, kinetic competition between targeting and translation elongation dictates which substrates are translocated post-translationally. Unexpectedly, SRP binds most secretory ribosomal complexes before targeting signals are synthesized. We show non-coding mRNA elements can promote signal-independent SRP pre-recruitment. Our study defines the complex kinetic interplay between elongation and determinants in the polypeptide and mRNA modulating SRP-substrate selection and membrane targeting in vivo. Overall design: Ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and RNA-seq of subcellular fractions of ribosomes. Soluble and membrane bound ribosomes are separated by centrifugation, and SRP-bound ribosomes are immunoprecipitated from the soluble fraction.

PRJNA299160,A regression-based analysis of ribosome-profiling data reveals a conserved complexity to mammalian translation,"A fundamental goal of genomics is to identify the complete set of expressed proteins. Automated annotation strategies rely on assumptions about protein-coding sequences (CDSs), e.g., they are conserved, do not overlap, and exceed a minimum length. However, an increasing number of newly discovered proteins violate these rules. Here we present an experimental and analytical framework, based on ribosome profiling and linear regression, for systematic identification and quantification of translation. Application of this approach to lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse dendritic cells and HCMV-infected human fibroblasts identifies thousands of novel CDSs, including micropeptides and variants of known proteins, that bear the hallmarks of canonical translation and exhibit comparable translation levels and dynamics to annotated CDSs. Remarkably, many translation events are identified in both mouse and human cells even when the peptide sequence is not conserved. Our work thus reveals an unexpected complexity to mammalian translation suited to provide both conserved regulatory or protein-based functions. Overall design: 37 ribosome footprint samples from mouse BMDCs across a time course of LPS stimulation and in the presence or absence of translation inhibitors cycloheximide, harringtonine, or lactimidomycin. A mock (non-LPS stimulated) time course is also included, collected in the presence of cycloheximide. Two replicates are available for the LPS timecourse under CHX treatment.

A key step is the depletion of ribosomal RNA that allows sufficient depth of sequencing of the mRNA undergoing ribosomal translation.

PRJEB7276,Examples of ribosome profiling in chlamydomonas and mouse,"Ribosome profiling is a technique that permits genome-wide, quantitative analysis of translation and has found broad application in recent years. Here, we describe a modified profiling protocol and software package designed to benefit more broadly the translation community in terms of simplicity and utility. The protocol, applicable to diverse organisms, including organelles, is based largely on previously published profiling methodologies, but employs duplex-specific nuclease as a convenient, bias-free, species-independent way to reduce rRNA contamination. Our protocol typically produces high levels of triplet periodicity, facilitating the detection of coding sequences, including upstream, downstream and overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). This feature also allows the identification of an alternative ribosome conformation evident during termination of protein synthesis. To test the effectiveness of DSN in ribosome profiling, we generated Ribo-Seq libraries from mouse tissue culture cells and from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii."

Here we describe the first Ribo-Seq/PUNCH-P comparison via the analysis of mammalian cells during the cell-cycle for detecting relevant differentially expressed genes between G1 and M phase. Our analyses suggest that the two approaches significantly overlap with each other. However, we demonstrate that there are biologically meaningful proteins/genes that can be detected to be post-transcriptionally regulated during the mammalian cell cycle only by each of the approaches, or their consolidation. Such gene sets are enriched with proteins known to be related to intra-cellular signalling pathways such as central cell cycle processes, central gene expression regulation processes, processes related to chromosome segregation, DNA damage, and replication, that are post-transcriptionally regulated during the mammalian cell cycle. Moreover, we show that combining the approaches better predicts steady state changes in protein abundance. The results reported here support the conjecture that for gaining a full post-transcriptional regulation picture one should integrate the two approaches. Overall design: Two Ribo-Seq experiments, which included parallel RNA-Seq, one with 3 replicates, and the other with one replicate, totalling 4 technical replicates for the G1 and M phases of the cell cycle, respectively (totalling 16 samples), were performed."
PRJNA297288,Circadian and feeding rhythms differentially affect rhythmic mRNA transcription and translation in mouse liver [Ribosome Profiling],"Diurnal oscillations of gene expression are a hallmark of rhythmic physiology across most living organisms. Such oscillations are controlled by the interplay between the circadian clock and feeding rhythms. While rhythmic mRNA accumulation has been extensively studied, comparatively less is known about their transcription and translation. Here, we quantified simultaneously temporal transcription, accumulation, and translation of mouse liver mRNAs under physiological light-dark conditions and ad libitum or night-restricted feeding in wild-type and Bmal1 deficient animals. We found that rhythmic transcription predominantly drives rhythmic mRNA accumulation and translation for a majority of genes. Comparison of wild-type and Bmal1 KO mice shows that circadian clock and feeding rhythms have broad impact on rhythmic genes expression, Bmal1 deletion having surprisingly more impact at the post-transcriptional level. Translation efficiency is differentially regulated during the diurnal cycle for genes with 5'-TOP sequences and for genes involved in mitochondrial activity and harboring a TISU motif. The increased translation efficiency of 5'-TOP and TISU genes is mainly driven by feeding rhythms but Bmal1 deletion impacts also amplitude and phase of translation, including TISU genes. Together this study emphasizes the complex interconnections between circadian and feeding rhythms at several steps ultimately determining rhythmic gene expression and translation. Overall design: RIbosome profiling from total RNA of mouse liver during the dirunal cycle. Time-series ribosome density of wild type (WT) and Bmal -/- mice under ad libitum and night restriced feeding regimen were generated by deep sequencing."
PRJNA297039,Heterogeneous ribosomes exist and selectively translate distinct subpools of mRNAs in stem cells,"Emerging studies have linked the ribosome to more selective control of gene regulation. However, an outstanding question is whether ribosome heterogeneity at the level of core ribosomal proteins (RPs) enables ribosomes to preferentially translate specific mRNAs genome-wide. Here, we measured the absolute abundance of RPs in translating ribosomes and profiled transcripts that are enriched or depleted from select subsets of ribosomes within embryonic stem cells. We find that heterogeneity in RP composition endows ribosomes with different selectivity for translating subpools of transcripts including those controlling metabolism, the cell cycle, and development. As a paradigm example, we show that mRNAs enriched in binding to RPL10A/uL1-containing ribosomes require RPL10A/uL1 for their efficient translation. Within several of these transcripts, we find this level of regulation is mediated, at least in part, by internal ribosome entry sites. Together, these results reveal a critical functional link between ribosome heterogeneity and the post-transcriptional circuitry of gene expression. Overall design: To identify the transcripts specifically translated by ribosomes demarcated by RPL10A or RPS25, we enriched for RPL10A or RPS25-containing ribosomes by immunoprecipitation (IP), and performed RPL10A-Ribo-Seq and RPS25-Ribo-Seq (2 replicates each), with the control being total Ribo-Seq (2 replicates each). To further assess the translation efficiencies of mRNAs upon Rpl10a knockdown at genome-wide scale, we performed RNA-Seq (2 replicates each) of purified RNAs from combined medium and heavy polysome fractions containing the most actively translating ribosomes (>=4 ribosomes along a mRNA molecule), and from all other fractions containing the free ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), 40S/60S ribosomal free subunits, 80S/monosomes as well as light polysomes (2-3 ribosomes per mRNA molecule)."
PRJEB6653,Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of pig induced pluripotent stem cells by high-throughput sequencing,"The wide application of pig disease model has caused a surge of interest in the study ofderivation of pig induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs). Here we performed genome-wide analysis of gene expression profiling by RNA-seq and small RNA-seq and DNA methylation profile by MeDIP-seq in pig iPSCs through comparison with somatic cells. We identified mRNA and microRNA transcripts that were specifically expressed in pig iPSCs. Our analysis identifies the genes up-regulated in pig iPS compared with somatic cells and also the differentially expressed genes between pig iPSCs under different culture medium. We then pursued comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, including functional annotation of the generated data within the context of biological pathways, to uncover novel biological functions associated with maintenance of pluripotency in pig. This result supports that pig iPS have transcript profiles linked to “ribosome”, “chromatin remodeling”, and genes involved in “cell cycle “that may be critical to maintain their pluripotency, plasticity, and stem cell function. Our analysis demonstrates the key role of RNA splicing in regulating the pluripotency phenotype of pig cells. Specifically, the data indicate distinctive expression patterns for SALL4 spliced variants in different pig cell types and highlight the necessity of defining the type of SALL4 when addressing the expression of this gene in pig cells. MeDIP-seq data revealed that the distribution patterns of methylation signals in pig iPS and somatic cells along the genome. We identify 25 novel porcine miRNA, including pluripotency-related miR-302/367cluster up-regulated in pig iPSCs. At last, we profile the dynamic gene expression signature of pluripotent genes in the preimplantation development embryo of pig. The resulting comprehensive data allowed us to compare various different subsets of pig pluripotent cell. This information provided by our analysis will ultimately advance the efforts at generating stable naïve pluripotency in pig cells."
PRJNA296059,A spectral analysis approach to detects actively translated open reading frames in high resolution ribosome profiling data,"RNA sequencing protocols allow for quantifying gene expression regulation at each individual step, from transcription to protein synthesis. Ribosome Profiling (Ribo-seq) maps the positions of translating ribosomes over the entire transcriptome. Despite its great potential, a rigorous statistical approach to identify translated regions from Ribo-seq data is not yet available. To fill this gap, we developed RiboTaper, which quantifies the significance of the three-nucleotide periodicity of Ribo-seq reads via spectral analysis methods.

Here, we combined functional genomics approaches to characterize tsRNAs and their regulation in Drosophila. We transfected S2 cells with molecular mimics of two tsRNAs, both derived from the 5’ end of endogenous Drosophila tRNA-Asp (5’-tsRNA-Asp). We investigated the regulatory impact of these molecules on the transcriptome and translatome by combining small RNA-Seq, poly(A) + mRNA-Seq, degradome-Seq and ribosome profiling (ribo-Seq) approaches. Furthermore, the comparison of small RNA-Seq, poly(A) + mRNA-Seq, and ribosome profiling (ribo-Seq) datasets under serum and serum-free conditions revealed that tsRNAs might act as messengers to coordinate the general translation machinery."

PRJNA295296,Clarifying the translational pausing landscape in bacteria by ribosome profiling,"The rate of protein synthesis varies according to the mRNA sequence in ways that affect gene expression. Global analysis of translational pausing is now possible with ribosome profiling. Here, we revisit an earlier report that Shine-Dalgarno sequences are the major determinant of translational pausing in bacteria. Using refinements in the profiling method as well as biochemical assays, we find that SD motifs have little (if any) effect on elongation rates. We argue that earlier evidence of pausing arose from two factors. First, in previous analyses, pauses at Gly codons were difficult to distinguish from pauses at SD motifs. Second, and more importantly, the initial study preferentially isolated long ribosome-protected mRNA fragments that are enriched in SD motifs. These findings clarify the landscape of translational pausing in bacteria as observed by ribosome profiling. Overall design: Ribosome profiling (three replicates) and RNAseq (two replicates) of E. coli MG1655"
PRJNA294100,Advancing Trypanosoma brucei genome annotation through ribosome profiling and spliced leader mapping,"Since the initial publication of the trypanosomatid genomes, curation has been ongoing. Here we apply the technique of ribosome profiling to Trypanosoma brucei, identifying 223 new coding regions by virtue of ribosome occupancy in the corresponding transcripts. A small number of these putative genes correspond to extra copies of previously annotated genes but 85% are novel. The median size of these novels CDSs is small (74 aa) indicating that past annotation work has excelled at detecting large CDSs. Of the unique CDSs discovered here, over half have candidate orthologues in other trypanosomatid genomes, most of which were not yet annotated as genes. Still, approximately one-third of the new CDSs were found only in T. brucei subspecies. When combined with RNA-seq and spliced leader mapping, we were able to definitively revise the start sites for 430 CDSs as compared to the current gene models. Such data also allowed us to use a structured approach to eliminate 701 putative genes as protein-coding. Finally, the data pointed to several regions of the genome that had sequence errors that altered coding region boundaries. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and mRNA libraries were constructed in triplicate from in vitro  PCF and in vivo  BF lifestages of theT. brucei Treu927 and in vitro T. brucei  Lister427, to evaluate role of translational gene regulation"
PRJNA293433,HT-SuperSAGE of the gut tissue of a Vip3A-resistant Heliothis virescens F. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) strain provides insights into its evolution and toxin adaptation,"Summary: Multi-toxins Bt-crops carrying insecticidal toxins with similar host spectrum and different mode of action e.g. Cry and Vip, are expected to improve resistance management in target pests. Control failure has been informed for Cry toxins but not for Vip3A, of which no mechanism of resistance has yet been identified. Here we applied HT-SuperSAGE to analyze the transcriptome profiling in the midgut tissue of a tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens (F.) strain laboratory-selected for Vip3A resistance. A total of 1324252 26-bp tags were sequenced representing 17751 unique transcripts (UniTags) from genetically similar Vip3A-resistant (Vip-Sel) strain and susceptible control (Vip-Unsel) strain. Differential expression was found significant (= 2.5-fold or = 0.4) for 1845 unigenes that constitute 10.4% of the total number of UniTags, where 277 represented overexpressed (OE) and 1568 underexpressed (UE) genes in Vip-Sel compared to Vip-Unsel. BLASTN searches mapped 1141 of these UniTags to H. virescens EST sequences, of which, 816 (143 OE and 673 UE) were unambiguously annotated to proteins in NCBI non-redundant protein databases. Gene ontology revealed Vip3A adaptation induced major constitutive transcriptional differences in serine-proteases (SP)-mediated proteolysis, ribosome biogenesis and metabolic processes. Several unigenes homologous to a particular member of the REsponse to PAThogen (REPAT) family were found to be predominantly OE. Since UniTags related to SP and ribosomal proteins (RP) were the most represented in the libraries, they were further analyzed in details. Interestingly, UniTags related to the putative Vip3A-binding protein RpS2 were underexpressed, while, the tumorigenesis suppressor RpL37 accounted for the 35% of total overexpressed RP. A subset of unigenes was chosen to confirm the HT-SuperSAGE data by qRT-PCR. The present study is the first providing a lepidopteran gut transcriptome associated with Vip3A resistance and a foundation for future attempts to elucidate the resistance mechanism. Overall design: Methods: Midgut transcriptional profiles of third-instar larvae from genetically similar Vip3A-resistant (Vip-Sel) and susceptible control (Vip-Unsel) strains were generated by HT-SuperSAGE. RNA pools of Vip-Sel and Vip-Unsel samples (five RNA preparations each) were prepared and used for the construction of SuperSAGE libraries HvR_GCCT and HvS_GCAC, respectively, according to the procedure described by [Matsumura et al., 2010]. Purified PCR products were mixed and applied to Illumina Genome Analyzer II sequencing with GEX (DpnII) primer in the sequencing reactions as recommended by the manufacturer. Sorting of sequence reads based on index sequences and the subsequent extraction of sequence tags from reads was conducted using a script written in Perl. Fold-change for each tag was calculated as in [Gilardoni et al., 2010]. qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays."
PRJNA292862,Ribosome Profiling of mouse skin squamous tumours,"Purpose: Ribosome profiling has revolutionized systems-based analysis and which produces a “global snapshot” of all the ribosomes translationally active in a cell at a particular moment. The goals of this study are to first apply ribosome profiling to in vivo samples for the first time and in particular to stem cells and tumours and second to determine which mRNAs are being actively translated in these particular situations. Although much is known about gene expression regulation, little is known about how protein translation regulation can affect stem cell differentiation and tumour progression. Methods: several replicates of  ribosome and mRNA profiles of wild-type (WT) and NSun2 -/- mouse skin squamous tumours were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq platform. Results: Our analyses reveal that activation of stress response pathways in vivo drives both a global reduction of protein synthesis and altered translation of specific mRNAs that together promote stem cell functions and tumourigenesis.

PRJNA292861,Genome-wide profilings of transcriptome and translatome in mouse hippocampi after contextual fear conditioning,"Memory stabilization after learning requires transcriptional and translational regulations in the brain, yet the temporal molecular changes following learning have not been explored at the genomic scale. We here employed ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing to quantify the translational status and transcript levels in mouse hippocampus following contextual fear conditioning. We identified 104 genes that are dynamically regulated. Intriguingly, our analysis revealed novel repressive regulations in the hippocampus: translational suppression of ribosomal protein-coding genes at basal state; learning-induced early translational repression of specific genes; and late persistent suppression of a subset of genes via inhibition of ESR1/ERa signaling. Further behavioral analyses revealed that Nrsn1, one of the newly identified genes undergoing rapid translational repression, can act as a memory suppressor gene. This study unveils the yet unappreciated importance of gene repression mechanisms in memory formation. Overall design: The application of ribosome profiling and RNA-seq techniques to mouse hippocampi tissues after contextual fear conditioning and to mouse hippocampal primary cultures.  Mouse ESCs were also examined."

PRJNA292112,Post-translational buffering leads to convergent protein expression levels between primates,"Differences in gene regulation between human and closely related species influence phenotypes that are distinctly human. While gene regulation is a multi-step process, the majority of research concerning divergence in gene regulation among primates has focused on transcription.  To gain a comprehensive view of gene regulation, we surveyed genome-wide ribosome occupancy, which reflects levels of protein translation, in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. We further integrated mRNA and protein level measurements collected from matching cell lines. We find that, in addition to transcriptional regulation, the major factor determining protein level divergence between human and closely related species is post-translational buffering. Inter-species divergence in transcription is generally propagated to the level of protein translation. In contrast, gene expression divergence is often attenuated post-translationally, potentially mediated through post-translational modifications.  Results from our analysis indicate that post-translational buffering is a conserved mechanism that led to relaxation of selective constraint on transcript levels in humans. Overall design: Using ribosome profiling assays, we measured levels of protein translation transcriptome-wide in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 4 HapMap Yoruba individuals, 5 chimpanzee individuals, and 5 rhesus macaque individuals. Note that the data uploaded for the 4 Yoruba individuals were generated by further sequencing the libraries generated as part of the Battle et al QTL mapping study (GSE61742).

However, it is unclear how Msi2 recognizes and regulates mRNA targets in vivo and whether Msi2 primarily controls cell growth in all cell types. Here we identified Msi2 targets with HITSCLIP and revealed that Msi2 primarily recognizes mRNA 3UTRs at sites enriched in multiple copies of UAG motifs in epithelial progenitor cells. RNA-seq and ribosome profiling demonstrated that Msi2 promotes targeted mRNA decay without affecting translation efficiency. Unexpectedly, the most prominent Msi2 targets identified are key regulators that govern cell motility with a high enrichment in focal adhesion and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, in addition to regulators of cell growth and survival. Loss of Msi2 stimulates epithelial cellmigration, increases the number of focal adhesion and also compromises cell growth. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Msi2's recognition and repression of targets and uncover a key function of Msi2 in restricting epithelial cell migration.

PRJNA290152,Codon usage influences the local rate of translation elongation to regulate co-translational protein folding,"Codon usage bias is a universal feature of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes and has been proposed to regulate translation efficiency, accuracy and protein folding based on the assumption that codon usage affects translation dynamics.  The role of codon usage in regulating translation, however, is not clear and has been challenged by recent ribosome profiling studies. Here we used a Neurospora cell-free translation system to directly monitor the velocity of mRNA translation. We demonstrated that the use of preferred codons enhances the rate of translation elongation, whereas non-optimal codons slow translation. In addition, codon usage regulates ribosome traffic on the mRNA. These conclusions were supported by ribosome profiling results in vitro and in vivo with substrate mRNAs manipulated to increase signal over background noise.  We further show that codon usage plays an important role in regulating protein function by affecting co-translational protein folding. Together, these results resolve a long-standing fundamental question and demonstrate the importance of codon usage on protein folding. Overall design: For sample 1 and 2, ribosome-protected fragments (RPF) and mRNA sequencing from WT Neurospora transcriptome were extracted to examine the residence time of each codon to understand the decoding rate. For sample 3 and 4, RPFs of the fully optimized (OPT) Firefly luciferase as well as the chimera [(2-423)OPT-(424-550)WT] Firefly luciferase, both of which were individually targeted to the his3 locus, were extracted to monitor the codon-regulated translational kinetics in vivo. For sample 5-8, RPFs were extracted from in vitro translation reactions covering the OPT construct and three chimera construts: N-OP, (2-223)OPT-(224-550)WT; M-OP, (2-223)WT-(224-423)OPT-(424-550)WT; C-OP (2-423)WT-(424-550)OPT.

Intriguingly, however, a cancer-related DDX3 variant DDX3 R534H selectively preserves translation of genes encoding core nucleosome components. Additionally, DDX3 variants also shift ORF usage on select genes, such as RPLP1 and stress-response factors as an added mechanism of translation regulation during stress. Thus, DDX3 through both extensive and selective interactions with RNA and the ribosomal machinery helps to remodel the translational landscape under stress and in cancer. Overall design: Cells expressing either DDX3 WT or R534H variant were treated with or without sodium arsenite and lysed in the presence of cyclohexime.

The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome profiling of control of C. albicans ATCC 10231 (RNA-seq) to transcriptome profiling of garlic oil-treated C. albicans ATCC 10231 and to evaluate protocols for optimal high-throughput data analysis Methods:SDB medium, C. albicans cells and garlic oil were added to two separate 50 mL conical flasks. The initial cell concentrations in culture were both 105 CFU/mL. The cultures were incubated in a water bath shaker at 28 ºC with shaking at 150 rpm for 12 h. Garlic oil or PBS buffer were then added to the cultures to make the concentrations of garlic oil arrived at 0 (control) and 1.25 µl/mL, respectively. The cultures were continuously incubated at the same conditions for 5 h. The cells were then sampled and centrifuged. The cell precipitates in the control and 1.25 µl/mL garlic oil groups were quickly separately frozen at -80 ºC. Then total RNA were repared from the cell pellets. Results:The RNA sequencing results showed that many genes in C. albicans exposed to garlic oil were differentially expressed. Nearly three thousand genes were differentially expressed, with either an increase or decrease of more than twofold. Most of them were down regulated  while a small number were upregulated. Conclusions: Our study indicated that garlic oil induced differential expression of some critical genes, such as genes for cellular response to drugs, oxidation-reduction processes, pathogenesis, and the cellular response to starvation. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes were mainly clustered in 19 KEGG pathways, such as oxidative phosphorylation, spliceosome, cell cycle, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, pyrimidine metabolism, meiosis, RNA transport, ribosome biogenesis, and RNA degradation.

PRJNA288089,The Ski complex binds 80S ribosomes for 3’ to 5’ decay of mRNA,"Cytoplasmic degradation of eukaryotic mRNAs in 3’ to 5’ direction is catalyzed by the exosome complex together with the Ski complex and, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Ski7 protein. This exosome-Ski-system also degrades ribosome-associated aberrant mRNAs lacking a stop codon, a pathway called non-stop-mRNA decay (NSD). However, the interplay between the Ski components and the ribosome is unknown. Here, we report that the Ski complex can associate with ribosomes in vitro and in vivo independently of Ski7. Ribosome profiling suggests that this association is important for NSD but also for general mRNA turnover. A cryo-electron microscopy structure reveals that the Ski complex binds near the mRNA entry site of the 40S subunit, facilitating the threading of the mRNA into the Ski2 helicase. Collectively, these results demonstrate an unanticipated role for the Ski complex in mRNA decay of ribosome-associated mRNAs, mediated by a direct interaction with the translation machinery. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of 80S monosomes and in vivo pullouts of Ski complex associated 80S ribosomes. In vivo pullouts were performed using a yeast strain expressing C-terminally TAP (tandem affinity purification) tagged Ski3.

PRJNA287879,Rocaglamide A converts RNA helicase eIF4A into a sequence-specific translational repressor,"Rocaglamide A (RocA) typifies a novel class of protein synthesis inhibitors that selectively kill aneuploid tumor cells and repress translation of specific mRNAs. RocA targets eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), the prototypical DEAD-box RNA helicase, and its mRNA selectivity is proposed to reflect highly structured 5' UTRs that are very dependent on eIF4A-mediated unwinding. Here, we show that secondary structure in 5' UTRs is only a minor determinant for RocA selectivity and RocA does not repress translation by reducing eIF4A activity. Rather, in vitro and in vivo, RocA clamps eIF4A onto a specific sequence motif even after ATP hydrolysis. This artificially clamped eIF4A blocks 43S scanning, leading to premature, upstream translation initiation and reducing gene expression on transcripts bearing the RocA-eIF4A target sequence. In elucidating the mechanism of this lead anti-cancer compound and explaining its mRNA selectivity, we provide the first example of a drug stabilizing sequence-specific RNA-protein interactions.

PRJNA287112,The transcription and translation landscapes during human cytomegalovirus infection reveal novel host-pathogen interactions,"During its long infection cycle, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) extensively manipulates cellular gene expression to maintain conditions favorable for viral propagation. In order to reveal the signature of cellular genes that are manipulated by HCMV, we measured RNA abundance and rate of protein production through the course of HCMV infection. We characterized changes for most expressed cellular genes and although much of the regulation was transcriptional we uncover diverse and dynamic translational regulation for subsets of host genes, revealing unappreciated coordination in translational control that suggests common regulators Overall design: Ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq along HCMV infection"
PRJNA286795,Insights into the adaptive stress response of Arabidopsis thaliana to thermal stress by ribosomal profiling,"Environmental stress is detrimental to plants viability and requires an adequate reprogramming of cellular activities to maximize plant survival. We present a global analysis of the adaptive stress response of Arabidopsis thaliana to prolonged heat stress. We combine deep sequencing of RNA and ribosome protected fragments to provide genome wide map of adaptation to heat stress on at transcriptional and translational level. Our analysis shows that the genes with the highest upregulation upon heat stress are known heat-responsive gene, chaperons and other genes involved in protein folding control. Majority of these genes exhibits increase on both transcriptional and translational level. No translational inhibition or ribosome stalling was observed, which can be observed in the early thermal stress response, indicating that plants alter their cellular composition in order to adapt to the prolonged exposure to increased temperatures. Overall design: Comparing global transcriptional and translational control by RNA-Seq and Ribosome Profiling (mRNA-Seq of ribosome protected fragments – RPF)."
PRJNA286792,Ribosome profiling analysis of GADD34 null cells,"Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which results in the increased phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF2a, and widespread translational repression. Protein synthesis is subsequently restored following the stress-induced transcriptional upregulation of GADD34 (growth arrest and DNA damage transcript 34) protein, a regulator of an eIF2a phosphatase. Genome-wide ribosome foot-printing in WT and GADD34-/- MEFs established that GADD34 mRNA is translated in unstressed cells and identified numerous mRNAs, whose translation was dependent on GADD34 even in the absence of ER stress. Following UPR activation, temporal analyses showed that the translational profile in GADD34-/- MEFs was stalled, displaying a pattern that mirrors the early response to UPR in WT MEFs. Basal GADD34 expression is also required for de-repression of translation and displacement of ER-bound polysomes that occur in early UPR. Thus, the overall UPR response is delayed in the GADD34-/- MEFs, gradually recovering as CReP expression increased. These studies reveal a critical role for basal GADD34 in the propagation of UPR signals in MEFs and mice and suggest that delayed UPR signaling protects GADD34-/- mice from tunicamycin-induced renal toxicity. Overall design: Translational and transcriptional analysis mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking GADD34 during ER stress"
PRJNA286218,Genome-wide translational analysis of the effect of acute endurance exercise on mouse gastrocnemius,"Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the translational regulation of skeletal muscle during acute endurance exercise. Methods: We used mRNA-Seq and ribosome profiling to examine transcriptional and translational regulation, respectively. Result: There were clear distinctions between the profiles of transcription and translation even at a basal condition. TOP-motif genes were translationally suppressed immediately after the exercise. Other genes, such as Slc25a25 was significantly translationally up-regulated presumably in a mTOR-independent manner. Conclusion: There were diverse regulation between transcription and translation. Although many focused on overall protein synthesis to understand the effect of exercise, translational regulation of individual genes are required. Overall design: Transcriptional and translational profiles of mouse gastrocnemius with or without acute endurance exercise were generated using Ion PGM sequencer."
PRJNA286050,Altered gene expression associated with thermo-sensitive male sterility in rapeseed (Brassica napus) mutant SP2S,"To reveal the possible molecular mechanism underpinning the temperature sensitive male sterility, a comparative transcriptome analysis of the SP2S line and its NIL SP2F was conducted. Transcriptome differences between fertile and sterile plants were analyzed by using digital gene expression (DGE) tag profiling, and numerous differentially and specifically expressed transcripts were identified. By quantitative RT-PCR, expression levels of 10 genes randomly selected showed consistent expression patterns with the DGE data. A total of 827 up-regulated and 757 down-regulated expression transcripts in SP2S were identified, indicating  the complex responses to temperature in the SP2S line. Some genes in important pathways including ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, endocytosis, apoptosis, oxidative phosphorylation, purine metabolism, MAPK signaling, spliceosome,  and ribosome were up-regulated in SP2S while other genes in the pathways of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, basal transcription factors, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and CO2 fixation were down-regulated. Some genes involved in photosynthesis, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), pentose phosphate, and stress-responsive were also differentially expressed. Overall design: Two lines named TGMS SP2S and the wild-type SP2F were used in this study. SP2S was bred after consecutive generations of selfing from spontaneous mutation of partially male-sterile plants found in an inbred line, SP2, in 2007. The fertile NIL (near-isogenic line) SP2F had the same genetic background with SP2S. The seeds of SP2S and SP2F were sown in field in September and the seedlings were transplanted into a greenhouse in December after vernalization under field condition. The temperature was kept at 22°C and photoperiod was longer than 14h. Young floral buds from SP2S and SP2F were collected, put into RNAlater, and stored at -80°C until further processing. Total RNAs were extracted using the Trizol® Reagent (Invitrogen), and purified using TRK1001 Kit (LC Science, Houston, TX). The total RNA quantity and purity were analyzed by using of Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (Agilent, USA). The cDNAs were amplified according to the Illumina RNA-Seq protocol and sequenced on Illumina Hiseq2500 platform. Two groups of DGE libraries, each in three biological replicates, were constructed using total RNA of young floral buds of SP2S and SP2F grown at 22 Celsius degree with Illumina's Digital Gene Expression Tag Profiling Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. We performed the single end sequencing on an Illumina Hiseq2500 following the vendor's recommended protocol. The raw data containing adaptor sequences, tags with low quality sequences and unknown nucleotides N were filtered to obtain clean reads with 36 nt in length. Clean reads were then conducted for quality assessment. All clean tags were mapped to the unigenes of our assembled transcripts dataset and JGI Brassica rapa genome by Bowtie 2 software, only 1 bp mismatch is allowed. For monitoring the mapping events on both strands, both the sense and the complementary antisense sequences were included in the data collection. The number of perfect clean reads corresponding to each gene was calculated and normalized to the number of Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads (RPKM). Based on the expression levels, the significant DETs (Differentially expressed transcripts) among different samples were identified with the 3rd quartile of counts in all samples = 10, p value =0.05, and log2 fold-change=1. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was conducted for functional classification of DGTs and pathway analysis was carried out by using KEGG."

PRJNA285458,Ribosome profiling study of rli1 depeletion strain,"ABCE1/Rli1 functions as a ribosome recycling factor in vitro, but has not been shown to be crucial for recycling in vivo. We use ribosome profiling and biochemistry to define the role of Rli1 in living yeast. When Rli1 levels were diminished, 80S ribosomes accumulated at stop codons and, surprisingly, in the adjoining 3''UTRs of most genes. While ribosomes did not show preference for any reading frame in the 3''UTR, their enrichment at stop codons and His codons after histidine starvation is consistent with aberrant 3''UTR translation. Predicted 3''UTR translation products were detected by Western analysis and mass spectrometry, and their small sizes indicate a reinitiation mechanism. Eliminating ribosome-rescue factor Dom34 dramatically increases 3''UTR ribosome occupancy in Rli1 depleted cells, indicating that Dom34 clears the bulk of unrecycled ribosomes. Thus, Rli1 is crucial for ribosome recycling in vivo and for overall gene expression as it controls ribosome homeostasis and 3''UTR translation. Overall design: 10 biological samples are included in the study (2 mRNA-Seq samples and 8 ribosome footprinting samples). These include wild-type, rli1-depletion, rli1-depletion/dom34?, and RLI1 high-copy / dom34? strains. Samples are also included where cells were treated with 3-AT to starve for histidine."
PRJNA285346,Nonsense-Mediated Decay restricts lncRNAs levels in yeast unless blocked by double-stranded RNA structure,"Antisense long non-coding (aslnc)RNAs represent a substantial part of eukaryotic transcriptomes that are, in yeast, controlled by the Xrn1 exonuclease. Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) destabilizes the Xrn1-sensitive aslncRNAs (XUT), but what determines their sensitivity remains unclear. We report that 3’ single-stranded (3’-ss) extension mediates XUTs degradation by NMD, assisted by the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases. Single-gene investigation, genome-wide RNA analyses and double-stranded (ds)RNA mapping revealed that 3''-ss extensions discriminate the NMD-targeted XUTs from stable lncRNAs. Ribosome profiling showed that XUT are translated locking them for NMD activity. Interestingly, mutants of the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases accumulated XUTs, suggesting that dsRNA unwinding is a critical step for degradation. Indeed, expression of anti-complementary transcripts protects cryptic intergenic lncRNAs from NMD. Our results indicate that aslncRNAs form dsRNA that are only translated and targeted to NMD if dissociated by Mtr4 and Dbp2. We propose that NMD buffers genome expression by discarding pervasive regulatory transcripts. Overall design: Strand-specific transcriptome analysis of biological replicates (1) of WT and xrn1-delta cells of the S288C, W303 and SK1 (n & 2n) genetic background of S. cerevisiae; (2) of WT, dcp2-7 and upf1-delta cells; (3) of WT, xrn1-delta and dcp2-7 cells upon treatment of total RNA with Terminator 5''-Phosphate-Dependent Exonuclease. This record also contains CAGE-Seq analysis in wild-type and decapping-deficient cells of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae."
PRJEB7498,Ribosome profiling in mammalian tissue reveals extensive translational regulation in the cardiometabolic syndrome,"The extent of translational control of gene expression in mammalian tissues remains largely unknown. We analyzed genome-wide RNA expression and ribosome occupancies in heart and liver tissues to investigate strain-specific translational regulation in disease-relevant tissues in the rat. For the most part, transcriptional variation is equally apparent at the translational level and there is limited evidence of translational buffering. In addition we also find hundreds of strain-specific differences in gene expression at the level of translation only that are influencing protein levels beyond transcriptional regulation. By integrating genetic, transcriptional and translational datasets we identify distinct signatures in 3’UTR variation, RNA binding protein motifs, and miRNA expression associated with translational regulation. We document novel and extensive translational control of important metabolic and cardiac genes. Several genes associated with heart and liver traits in human genome wide association studies are regulated at the translational level. Capturing inter-individual differences in the translated genome will lead to new insights into the genes and regulatory pathways underlying disease phenotypes."
PRJNA285265,Transcriptome and translatome landscape of Streptomyces coelicolor M145,"We have integrated nucleotide resolution genome-scale measurements of the transcriptome and translatome of the Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), the model antibiotic-producing actinomycete. Our systematic study determined 3,473 transcription start sites, leading to discovery of a high proportion (~21%) of leaderless mRNAs and 230 non-coding RNAs; this enabled deduction of promoter architecture on a genome-scale. Ribosome profiling analysis revealed that the translation efficiency was negatively correlated for secondary metabolic genes. These results provide novel fundamental insights into translational regulation of secondary metabolism that enables rational synthetic biology approaches to awaken such ‘silent’ secondary metabolic pathways. Overall design: Profiles of primary transcripts, whole transcripts, and ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) of  Streptomyces coelicolor were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Miseq."
PRJNA284399,Time-Resolved Proteomics Extends Ribosome Profiling-Based Measurements of Protein Synthesis Dynamics,"Ribosome profiling is a widespread tool for studying translational dynamics in human cells.  Its central assumption is that ribosome footprint density on a transcript quantitatively reflects protein synthesis.  Here, we test this assumption using pulsed-SILAC (pSILAC) high-accuracy targeted proteomics.  We focus on multiple myeloma cells exposed to bortezomib, a first-line chemotherapy and proteasome inhibitor. In the absence of drug effects, we found that direct measurement of protein synthesis by pSILAC correlated well with indirect measurement of synthesis from ribosome footprint density.  This correlation, however, broke down under bortezomib-induced stress. By developing a statistical model integrating longitudinal proteomic and mRNA-seq measurements, we found that proteomics could directly detect global alterations in translational rate caused by bortezomib; these changes are not detectable by ribosomal profiling alone.  Further, by incorporating pSILAC data into a gene expression model, we predict cell-stress specific proteome remodeling events.  These results demonstrate that pSILAC provides an important complement to ribosome profiling in measuring proteome dynamics. Overall design: Timecourse experiment with six points over 48hr after bortezomib exposure in MM.1S myeloma cells.  mRNA-seq and ribosome profiling data at each time point."
PRJNA283800,Bacteria differently regulate mRNA abundance to specifically respond to various stresses,"Environmental stress is detrimental to cell viability and requires an adequate reprogramming of cellular activities to maximize cell survival. We present a global analysis of the response of Escherichia coli to acute heat and osmotic stress. We combine deep sequencing of total mRNA and ribosome-protected fragments to provide a genome-wide map of the stress response at transcriptional and translational level. For each type of stress, we observe a unique subset of genes that shape the stress-specific response. Upon temperature upshift, mRNAs with reduced folding stability up- and downstream of the start codon, and thus with more accessible initiation regions, are translationally favoured. Conversely, osmotic upshift causes a global reduction of highly-translated transcripts with high copy numbers, allowing reallocation of translation resources to undegraded and newly synthesised mRNAs Overall design: Comparing global transcriptional and translational control by mRNA-Seq and Ribosome Profiling (mRNA-Seq of ribosome protected fragments – RPF)"
PRJEB6650,miRNA profiling analysis of pig induced pluripotent stem cells by high-throughput sequencing,"The wide application of pig disease model has caused a surge of interest in the study of derivation of pig induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs). Here we performed genome-wide analysis of gene expression profiling by RNA-seq and small RNA-seq and DNA methylation profile by MeDIP-seq in pig iPSCs through comparison with somatic cells. We identified mRNA and microRNA transcripts that were specifically expressed in pig iPSCs. Our analysis identifies the genes up-regulated in pig iPS compared with somatic cells and also the differentially expressed genes between pig iPSCs under different culture medium. We then pursued comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, including functional annotation of the generated data within the context of biological pathways, to uncover novel biological functions associated with maintenance of pluripotency in pig. This result supports that pig iPS have transcript profiles linked to “ribosome”, “chromatin remodeling”, and genes involved in “cell cycle “that may be critical to maintain their pluripotency, plasticity, and stem cell function. Our analysis demonstrates the key role of RNA splicing in regulating the pluripotency phenotype of pig cells. Specifically, the data indicate distinctive expression patterns for SALL4 spliced variants in different pig cell types and highlight the necessity of defining the type of SALL4 when addressing the expression of this gene in pig cells. MeDIP-seq data revealed that the distribution patterns of methylation signals in pig iPS and somatic cells along the genome. We identify 25 novel porcine miRNA, including pluripotency-related miR-302/367cluster up-regulated in pig iPSCs. At last, we profile the dynamic gene expression signature of pluripotent genes in the preimplantation development embryo of pig. The resulting comprehensive data allowed us to compare various different subsets of pig pluripotent cell. This information provided by our analysis will ultimately advance the efforts at generating stable naïve pluripotency in pig cells."
PRJNA283426,Genome-wide reprogramming of transcript architecture by temperature specifies the developmental states of the human pathogen Histoplasma [transcriptional profiling],"Eukaryotic cells integrate layers of gene regulation to coordinate complex cellular processes; however, mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulation remain poorly studied. The human fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) responds to environmental or host temperature by initiating unique transcriptional programs to specify multicellular (hyphae) or unicellular (yeast) developmental states that function in infectivity or pathogenesis, respectively. Here we used recent advances in next-generation sequencing to uncover a novel post-transcriptional mechanism of gene regulation in Hc developmental cell types. We found that ~2% percent of Hc transcripts exhibit 5’ leader sequences that differ markedly in length between morphogenetic states. Ribosome density and mRNA abundance measurements uncovered a class of differential leader transcripts that exhibit tight transcriptional and translational regulation. Further examination of these dually regulated genes revealed that some control Hc morphology and that their strict regulation is necessary for the pathogen to make appropriate developmental decisions in response to temperature.  This series contains expression profiling data for four strains of Hc. Overall design: Expression profiling by paired-end RNA sequencing was performed for two biological replicates for each of four strains of Histoplasma capsulatum (G217B, G186AR, H88, and H143) from cells grown in the yeast or hyphal phase (16 samples total)."

PRJNA282960,Dissection of the translational impacts of the PERK pathway,"Disruptions of protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) elicit activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a translation- and transcription-coupled proteostatic stress response pathway. The primary translational control arm of the UPR is initiated by the PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2a, leading to a large-scale reprogramming of translation and subsequent activation of an ATF4-mediated transcriptional program. It has remained challenging, however, to accurately evaluate the contribution of each component of the eIF2a/ATF4 pathway to the remodelling of transcription and translation. Here, we have used mouse embryonic fibroblasts containing either a knock-in of the non-phosphorylatable eIF2a S51A mutant or knock-out for ATF4 by ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq to define the specific contributions of eIF2a phosphoryation and ATF4 in controlling the translational and transcriptional components of the UPR. These studies show that the transcriptional and translational targets of each P-eIF2a, ATF4, and the other UPR gene expression programs overlapped extensively, leading to a core set of UPR genes whose robust expression in response to ER stress is driven by multiple mechanisms. The identification of other, more factor-specific targets illustrated the potential for functional specialization of the UPR. As the UPR progressed temporally, cells employed distinct combinations of transcriptional and translational mechanisms, initiated by different factors, to adapt to ongoing stress. These effects were accompanied by a buffering effect where changes in mRNA levels were coupled to opposing changes in ribosome loading, a property which makes cooperation between transcription and translation essential to confer robust protein expression. Overall design: Translational analysis by ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq of PERK pathways mutants during the UPR. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking components of the PERK pathway (eIF2a phosphorylation and ATF4) were subjected to ER stress and analyzed by ribosome profiling."
PRJNA282044,MYC is a major determinant of mitotic cell fate,"Purpose: To determine global gene expression changes following siRNA knockdown of Myc, Kcnk1, and Snta1 compared to non-targeting siRNAs or mock-transfected cells Methods: Total RNA was processed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit according to manufacturer's protocol. Generated cDNA libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer with four biological replicates sequenced per condition using single read, 50 cycle runs. Quality of sequencing reads were assessed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics) and then aligned to a reference genome (hg19, UCSC Genome Browser) using TopHat. Sequencing yielded, on average, 23.7 million unique reads per sample with a 60.7 - 65.7% mapping rate. Cufflinks was used to generate transcript abundance for each annotated protein-coding gene as Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM), and statistical analysis and comparison of FPKM values was calculated using R (Bioconductor). Results: Fold changes comparing mock and a non-targeting siRNA were highly congruent. Myc RNAi induced numerous changes, with 955 downregulated genes and 1214 upregulated genes. The effect on Myc itself was relatively modest, possibly reflecting its ability to negatively auto-regulate its own expression. Gene ontology analysis highlighted ribosome biogenesis, metabolism, gene expression, cell cycle, and apoptosis pathways, consistent with known Myc functions. The Kcnk1 siRNA affected 424 genes, with KCNK1 itself one of the most repressed. While gene ontology analysis also highlighted metabolism and biosynthesis pathways, the p-values and fold enrichment scores were substantially lower, indicating that DiM can be suppressed without major effects on metabolism and biosynthesis pathways. The Snta1 siRNA deregulated 575 genes, with SNTA1 itself the most repressed gene. Cell cycle and mitosis-related gene ontology terms feature heavily, consistent with this siRNA accelerating mitotic exit. Interestingly, FoxM1, which drives G2/M gene expression was reduced 1.75-fold, indicating that this siRNA may disrupt mitotic controls by deregulating FoxM1. Conclusions: Global gene expression profiling identifies Egr1 as regulator of mitotic cell fate. Overall design: Total RNA was extracted from at least four replicates of siRNA-transfected cells and libraries for sequencing was prepared for each replicate."
PRJNA282016,Ribosome Profiling Reveals Translational Control During the Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle,"The Caulobacter cell cycle includes sequential differentiation of the cell poles and an asymmetric cell division yielding distinct daughter cells.  RNA-seq and ribosome profiling were used to measure global messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance and translation levels throughout the Caulobacter cell cycle revealing translational control in 51% of cell cycle-regulated genes.   Ribosome profiling levels were temporally regulated for ten proteins encoding asymmetrically localized multi-protein assemblies that specify cell fate upon cell division, with five ORFs being regulated with a >2 fold contribution from the translation efficiency.  Individual ORFs within 198 operons undergo different cell cycle patterns of translation efficiency, allowing decoupling of the expression of these co-transcribed units.  This work reveals that, in addition to transcriptional control, there is prevalent translational control of cell cycle-regulated genes, providing a framework for a multi-level program of cell cycle control that generates daughter cells of different fates. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data were collected in sychronized Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 cells grown in M2G to measure changes in mRNA levels and translation levels during the asymmetric cell division cycle."

PRJNA281177,Regulation of protein translation during mitosis,"Entry into and exit from mitosis is driven by precisely-timed changes in protein abundance, and involves transcriptional regulation and protein degradation. However, the role of translational regulation in modulating cellular protein content during mitosis remains poorly understood. Here, using ribosome profiling, we show that translational, rather than transcriptional regulation is the dominant mechanism for modulating protein synthesis at mitotic entry. The vast majority of regulated mRNAs are translationally repressed, which contrasts previous findings of selective mRNA translational activation at mitotic entry. One of the most pronounced translationally repressed genes in mitosis is Emi1, an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex (APC), which is degraded during mitosis. We show that Emi1 degradation is insufficient for full APC activation and that simultaneous translational repression is required. These results provide a genome-wide view of protein translation during mitosis and suggest that translational repression may be used to ensure complete protein inactivation Overall design: Ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq from 3 time points in the cell cycle"

PRJNA279785,Optimization of codon translation rates via tRNA modifications maintains proteome integrity,"Proteins begin to fold as they emerge from translating ribosomes. The kinetics of ribosome transit along a given mRNA can influence nascent chain folding, but the extent to which individual codon translation rates impact proteome integrity remains unknown. Here, we show that slower decoding of discrete codons elicits widespread protein aggregation in vivo. Using ribosome profiling, we find that loss of anticodon wobble uridine (U34) modifications in a subset of tRNAs leads to ribosome pausing at their cognate codons in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans. Yeast cells lacking U34 modifications exhibit gene expression hallmarks of proteotoxic stress and accumulate aggregates of endogenous proteins with key cellular functions. Moreover, these cells are severely compromised in clearing stress-induced protein aggregates. Overexpression of hypomodified tRNAs alleviates ribosome pausing, concomitantly restoring protein homeostasis. Our findings demonstrate that modified U34 is an evolutionarily conserved accelerator of decoding and reveal an unanticipated role for tRNA anticodon modifications in maintaining proteome integrity. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of wild-type and tRNA modification-deficient yeast and nematodes. Yeast samples were generated in various growth conditions (rich medium versus stress induced by treatment with diamide or rapamycin) and paired mRNA-Seq was performed on a subset of samples. Dataset contains three biological replicates for yeast samples and two biological replicates for nematode samples."
PRJNA279465,Ribosome profiling reveals the rhythmic liver translatome and circadian clock regulation by upstream open reading frames,"Mammalian gene expression displays widespread circadian oscillations. Rhythmic transcription underlies the core clock mechanism, but it cannot explain numerous observations made at the level of protein rhythmicity. We have used ribosome profiling in mouse liver to measure the translation of mRNAs into protein around-the-clock and at high temporal and nucleotide resolution. Transcriptome-wide, we discovered extensive rhythms in ribosome occupancy, and identified a core set of ˜150 mRNAs subject to particularly robust daily changes in translation efficiency. Cycling proteins produced from non-oscillating transcripts revealed thus far unknown rhythmic regulation associated with specific pathways (notably in iron metabolism, through the rhythmic translation of transcripts containing iron responsive elements), and indicated feedback to the rhythmic transcriptome through novel rhythmic transcription factors. Moreover, estimates of relative levels of core clock protein biosynthesis that we deduced from the data explained known features of the circadian clock better than did mRNA expression alone. Finally, we identified uORF translation as a novel regulatory mechanism within the clock circuitry. Consistent with the occurrence of translated uORFs in several core clock transcripts, loss-of-function of Denr, a known regulator of re-initiation after uORF usage and of ribosome recycling, led to circadian period shortening in cells. In summary, our data offer a framework for understanding the dynamics of translational regulation, circadian gene expression, and metabolic control in a solid mammalian organ.

We found that IFN-g regulates macrophage metabolism and translation in an integrated manner by targeting mTORC1 and MNK pathways that converge on the selective regulator of translation initiation eIF4E. Physiological downregulation of the central metabolic regulator mTORC1 by IFN-g was associated with autophagy and translational suppression of repressors of inflammation such as HES1. Genome-wide ribosome profiling in TLR2-stimulated macrophages revealed that IFN-g selectively modulates the macrophage translatome to promote inflammation, further reprogram metabolic pathways, and modulate protein synthesis. These results add IFN-g-mediated metabolic reprogramming and translational regulation as key components of classical inflammatory macrophage activation. Overall design: RPF and RNAseq libraries were generated from mock or IFN-g-primed human macrophages. Cells were stimulated with Pam3Cys and harvested at 4 hours.

PRJNA277771,Integrated Transcriptome and Proteome Analyses Reveal Organ-Specific Proteome Deterioration in Old Rats,"Aging is associated with the decline of protein, cell, and organ function. Here, we use an integrated approach to characterize gene expression, bulk translation, and cell biology in the brains and livers of young and old rats. We identify 468 differences in protein abundance between young and old animals. The majority are a consequence of altered translation output, that is, the combined effect of changes in transcript abundance and translation efficiency. In addition, we identify 130 proteins whose overall abundance remains unchanged but whose sub-cellular localization, phosphorylation state, or splice-form varies. While some protein-level differences appear to be a generic property of the rats' chronological age, the majority are specific to one organ. These may be a consequence of the organ's physiology or the chronological age of the cells within the tissue. Taken together, our study provides an initial view of the proteome at the molecular, sub-cellular, and organ level in young and old rats.

PRJNA277363,Ribosome profiling reveals changes in translational status of soybean transcripts during immature cotyledon development,"To understand translational capacity on a genome-wide scale across three developmental stages of immature soybean seed cotyledons, ribosome profiling was performed in combination with RNA sequencing and cluster analysis. Transcripts representing 216 unique genes demonstrated a higher level of translational activity in at least one stage by exhibiting higher translational efficiencies (TEs) in which there were relatively more ribosome footprint sequence reads mapping to the transcript than were present in the control total RNA sample. The majority of these transcripts were more translationally active at the early stage of seed development and included 12 unique serine or cysteine proteases and 16 2S albumin and low molecular weight cysteine-rich proteins that may serve as substrates for turnover and mobilization early in seed development. It would appear that the serine proteases and 2S albumins play a vital role in the early stages. In contrast, our investigation of profiles of 19 genes encoding high abundance seed storage proteins, such as glycinins, beta-conglycinins, lectin, and Kunitz trypsin inhibitors, showed that they all had similar patterns in which the TE values started at low levels and increased approximately 2 to 6-fold during development. The highest levels of these seed protein transcripts were found at the mid-developmental stage, whereas the highest ribosome footprint levels of only up to 1.6 TE were found at the late developmental stage.  These experimental findings suggest that the major seed storage protein coding genes are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level during normal soybean cotyledon development. Finally, our analyses also identified a total of 370 unique gene models that showed very low TE values including over 48 genes encoding ribosomal family proteins and 95 gene models that are related to energy and photosynthetic functions, many of which have homology to the chloroplast genome. Overall design: Construction of ribosome profiling libraries using cotyledons from 3 different developmental stages, with two biological replicates. Data was obtained also from two stages of seed coat development."
PRJNA276827,Genome-wide analysis of translational efficiency reveals distinct but overlapping functions of yeast DEAD-box RNA helicases Ded1 and eIF4A,"DEAD-box RNA helicases eIF4A and Ded1 are believed to promote translation initiation by resolving mRNA secondary structures that impede ribosome attachment at the mRNA 5' end or subsequent scanning of the 5'UTR, but whether they perform distinct functions or act redundantly in vivo is poorly understood. We compared the effects of mutations in Ded1 or eIF4A on global translational efficiencies (TEs) in yeast by ribosome footprint profiling. Despite similar reductions in bulk translation, inactivation of a cold-sensitive Ded1 mutant substantially reduced the TEs of >600 mRNAs, whereas inactivation of a temperature-sensitive eIF4A mutant yielded <40 similarly impaired mRNAs. The broader requirement for Ded1 did not reflect more pervasive secondary structures at low temperature, as inactivation of temperature-sensitive and cold-sensitive ded1 mutants gave highly correlated results. Interestingly, Ded1-dependent mRNAs exhibit greater than average 5'UTR length and propensity for secondary structure, implicating Ded1 in scanning though structured 5' UTRs. Reporter assays confirmed that cap- distal stem-loop insertions increase dependence on Ded1 but not eIF4A for efficient translation. While only a small fraction of mRNAs is strongly dependent on eIF4A, this dependence is significantly correlated with requirements for Ded1 and 5'UTR features characteristic of Ded1- dependent mRNAs. Our findings suggest that Ded1 is critically required to promote scanning through secondary structures within 5'UTRs; and while eIF4A cooperates with Ded1 in this function, it also promotes a step of initiation common to virtually all yeast mRNAs. Overall design: We compared the effects of mutations in Ded1 or eIF4A on global translational efficiencies (TEs) in yeast by ribosome footprint profiling.The study includes 32 samples, comprised of 16 mRNA-Seq samples and 16 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from biological replicates of 3 mutant strains, ded1-cs, ded1-ts and tif1-ts, and the corresponding wild-type strains. The tif1-ts mutant and its wild-type counterpart were analyzed at 30°C and 37°C."

PRJNA275789,MicroRNA-203 represses selection and expansion of oncogenic HRas transformed tumor initiating cells [seq],"In many mouse models of skin cancer, only a few tumors typically form although many cells competent for tumorigenesis receive the same oncogenic mutations. These observations suggest a selection process for defining tumor initiating cells. Here we use quantitative mRNA- and miR-Seq to determine the impact of HRasG12V on the transcriptome of keratinocytes. We discover that microRNA-203 is downregulated by HRasG12V. Using a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that loss of microRNA-203 promotes selection and expansion of tumor-initiating cells. Conversely, restoration of microRNA-203 with an inducible model potently inhibits proliferation of these cells. We comprehensively identify microRNA-203 targets required for HRas-initiated tumorigenesis. These targets include important effectors of the Ras pathway and essential genes required for cell division. Together, this study establishes a role for the loss of microRNA-203 in promoting selection and expansion of HRas mutated cells and identifies a mechanism through which microRNA-203 antagonizes HRas-mediated tumorigenesis. Overall design: Identifying mRNA and microRNA networks regulated by oncogenic HRasG12V in primary keratinocytes through the use of 3Seq and small-RNA-Sequencing. Additionally we utilize ribosome-profiling, 3Seq, Microarray and Ago2-HITS-CLIP approaches to identify novel miR-203 target genes."

PRJNA275667,The contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome,"Alu elements are major contributors to lineage-specific new exons in primate and human genomes. Recent studies indicate that some Alu exons have high transcript inclusion levels or tissue-specific splicing profiles, and may play important regulatory roles in modulating mRNA degradation or translational efficiency. However, the contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome remains unclear and controversial. The prevailing view is that exons derived from young repetitive elements, such as Alu elements, are restricted to regulatory functions and have not had adequate evolutionary time to be incorporated into stable, functional proteins. We adopt a proteotranscriptomics approach to systematically assess the contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome. Using RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling and proteomics data from human tissues and cell lines, we provide evidence for the translational activities of Alu exons and the presence of Alu exon derived peptides in human proteins. These Alu exon peptides represent species-specific protein differences between primates and other mammals, and in certain instances between humans and closely related primates. In the case of the RNA editing enzyme ADARB1, which contains an Alu exon peptide in its catalytic domain, RNA sequencing analyses of A-to-I editing demonstrate that both the Alu exon skipping and inclusion isoforms encode active enzymes. The Alu exon derived peptide may fine tune the overall editing activity and, in limited cases, the site selectivity of ADARB1 protein products. Our data indicate that Alu elements have contributed to the acquisition of novel protein sequences during primate and human evolution. Overall design: Comparing the A-I RNA editing levels of HEK293 cells transfected with empty vector (CV) control, Alu exon inclusion (long) isoform of ADARB1, and Alu exon skipping (short) isoform of ADARB1.

Although variation in RNA levels, transcription factor binding and chromatin have been explored, little is known about global variation in translation and its genetic determinants among humans. We used ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry to perform an integrated analysis in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a diverse group of individuals. We find significant differences in RNA levels, translation, and protein abundance suggesting diverse mechanisms of personalized gene expression control. Combined analysis of RNA expression and ribosome occupancy improves the identification of individual protein level differences.  Finally, we identify genetic differences that specifically modulate ribosome occupancy - many of these differences lie close to start codons and upstream ORFs. Our results reveal a new level of gene expression variation among humans and indicate that genetic variants can cause changes in protein levels through effects on translation.

Treatment of such cells with tamoxifen rapidly induces Src, thereby making it possible to kinetically follow the transition between normal and transformed cells. The other model consists of three isogenic cell lines derived from primary fibroblasts in a serial manner (Hahn et al., 1999). EH cell is immortalized by overexpression of telomerase (hTERT), and exhibits normal fibroblast morphology. EL cell expresses hTERT along with both large and small T antigens of Simian virus 40, and it displays an altered morphology but is not transformed.

PRJNA275185,Ribosomes guide pachytene piRNA formation on long intergenic piRNA precursors,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs essential for fertility. In adult mouse testes, most piRNAs are derived from long single-stranded RNAs lacking annotated open reading frames (ORFs). The mechanisms underlying how piRNA sequences are defined during the cleavages of piRNA precursors remain elusive. Here, we show that 80S ribosomes translate the 5'-proximal short ORFs (uORFs) of piRNA precursors. The MOV10L1/Armitage RNA helicase then facilitates the translocation of ribosomes into the uORF downstream regions (UDRs). The ribosome-bound UDRs are targeted by piRNA processing machinery, with the processed ribosome-protected regions becoming piRNAs. The dual modes of interaction between ribosomes and piRNA precursors underlie the distinct piRNA biogenesis requirements at uORFs and UDRs. Ribosomes also mediate piRNA processing in roosters and green lizards, implying that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved in amniotes. Our results uncover a function for ribosomes on non-coding regions of RNAs and reveal the mechanisms underlying how piRNAs are defined. Overall design: High-throughput sequencing data including RNAseq, small RNAseq, Ribo-seq and Degradome-seq of mouse and lizard testis."
PRJNA274997,The Small Molecule ISRIB Reverses the Effects of eIF2α Phosphorylation on Translation and Stress Granule Assembly,"We recently identified ISRIB as a potent inhibitor of the integrated stress response (ISR). ISRIB renders cells resistant to the effects of eIF2a phosphorylation and enhances long-term memory in rodents (10.7554/eLife.00498).  Here we show by genome-wide in vivo ribosome profiling that translation of a restricted subset of mRNAs is induced upon ISR activation. ISRIB substantially reversed the translational effects elicited by phosphorylation of eIF2a and induced no major changes in translation or mRNA levels in unstressed cells. eIF2a phosphorylation-induced stress granule (SG) formation was blocked by ISRIB. Strikingly, ISRIB addition to stressed cells with pre-formed SGs induced their rapid disassembly, liberating mRNAs into the actively translating pool. Restoration of mRNA translation and modulation of SG dynamics may be an effective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by eIF2a phosphorylation, SG formation and cognitive loss.

PRJNA274500,Expression profiling of skeletal muscle in two breeds of duck (Anas platyrhynchos),"Background: Skeletal muscle growth and development is highly orchestrated in gene expressions. Understanding the location-specific and breed-specific genes and pathways are agriculturally important on meat products and meat quality. In the present study, RNA-Seq was performed to elucidate the difference of muscle deposition between locations and breeds for functional genomics studies. To achieve those goals, skeletal muscle samples were collected for pectoral muscle (PM) and leg muscle (LM) of two genetically different duck breeds, Heiwu duck (H) and Peking duck (P), at embryonic 15 days. Functional genomics studies were performed in two experiments: Experiment 1 directly compared location-specific genes between PM and LM, while Experiment 2 compared the two breeds (H and P) at the same development stage (embryonic 15 days). Results: Almost 13 million clean reads was generated using Illumina technology on each library, and more than 70% reads mapped to Anas platyrhynchos breed Peking duck genome. We identified 246, 258, 20 and 54 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (log2.fold-change >0.5, and P-value <0.05) for H-PM vs H-LM, P-PM vs P-LM, H-LM vs P-LM and H-PM vs P-PM library, separately. A total of 168 genes were differentially expressed by over locations in experiment 1, while only 8 genes were differentially expressed by over breeds in experiment 2. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways (KEGG) were used to functionally annotate DGEs. In experiment 1, DEGs mainly involved in Focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and ECM-receptor interaction pathways (corrected P-value<0.05). In experiment 2, DEGs only associated with ribosome signal pathway (corrected P-value<0.05). In addition, quantitative real-time PCR was employed to confirm 15 differentially expressed genes detected by RNA-Seq. Conclusions: Comparative transcript analysis of leg muscle and pectoral muscle of two duck breeds not only improves our understanding of those location-specific and breed-specific genes and pathways, but also provides some candidate molecular targets for increase muscle products and meat quality by genetic control. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of duck breed muscle transcriptomes generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions. Overall design: Total RNA of duck skeletal muscle at embryonic 15 days for four group muscles was extracted using Trizol reagent (Takara, china) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Five RNA samples per group were equally mixed to get a RNA pool."
PRJNA272597,Improved transcription and translation with L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1,"Roberts syndrome (RBS) is a human developmental disorder caused by mutations in the cohesin acetyltransferase ESCO2. We previously reported that mTORC1 was inhibited and overall translation was reduced in RBS cells. Treatment of RBS cells with L-leucine partially rescued mTOR function and protein synthesis, correlating with increased cell division. In this study, we use RBS as a model for mTOR inhibition and analyze transcription and translation with ribosome profiling to determine genome-wide effects of L-leucine. The translational efficiency of many genes is increased with Lleucine in RBS cells including genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and mitochondrial function. snoRNAs are strongly upregulated in RBS cells, but decreased with L-leucine. Imprinted genes, including H19 and GTL2, are differentially expressed in RBS cells consistent with contribution to mTORC1 control. This study reveals dramatic effects of L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1 and supports that ESCO2 function is required for normal gene expression and translation. Overall design: 42 samples of human fibroblast cell lines with various genotypes (wt, corrected, and esco2 mutants) are treated with l-leucine or d-leucine (control) for 3 or 24 hours.

Despite its application in many organisms, ribosome profiling studies in bacteria have struggled to obtain the resolution necessary to precisely define translational pauses. Here we report improvements that yield much higher resolution in E. coli profiling data, enabling us to more accurately assess ribosome pausing and refine earlier studies of the impact of polyproline motifs on elongation. We comprehensively characterize pausing at proline-rich motifs in the absence of elongation factor EFP. We find that only a small fraction of genes with strong pausing motifs have reduced ribosome density downstream and identify features that explain this phenomenon. These features allow us to predict which proteins likely have reduced output in the efp knockout strain.

PRJNA270712,Parkinson's disease genes VPS35 and EIF4G1 interact genetically and converge on alpha-synuclein,"Parkinson''s disease (PD) is a common human neurodegenerative movement disorder. Studies of the genetic forms of PD have helped to reveal disease mechanisms. Functional interactions between some Parkinson''s disease (PD) genes, like PINK1 and parkin, have been identified, but whether other ones interact remains elusive. Here we report an unexpected genetic interaction between two PD genes, VPS35 and EIF4G1. We provide evidence that EIF4G1 upregulation causes defects associated with protein misfolding. Expression of a sortilin protein rescues these defects, downstream of VPS35, suggesting a potential role for sortilins in PD. We also show interactions between VPS35, EIF4G1 and alpha-synuclein, a protein with a key role in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial PD. We extend our findings from yeast to an animal model and show these interactions are conserved in neurons. We also connect VPS35 impairments to neurodegeneration in alpha-synuclein transgenic mice. Our studies reveal unexpected genetic and functional interactions between two seemingly unrelated PD genes and functionally connect them to alpha-synuclein pathobiology in yeast, worms, and mouse. Finally, we provide a resource of candidate PD genes for future genetic and functional interrogation.

PRJNA269069,"Causal signals between codon bias, mRNA structure and the efficiency of translation and elongation","Ribosome profiling data reports on the distribution of translating ribosomes, at steady-state, with codon-level resolution. We present a robust method to extract codon translation rates and protein synthesis rates from these data, and identify causal features associated with elongation and translation efficiency in physiological conditions in yeast. We show that neither elongation rate nor translational efficiency is improved by experimental manipulation of the abundance or body sequence of the rare AGG tRNA. Deletion of three of the four copies of the heavily used ACA tRNA shows a modest efficiency decrease that could be explained by other rate-reducing signals at gene start. This suggests that correlation between codon bias and efficiency arises as selection for codons to utilize translation machinery efficiently in highly translated genes. We also show a correlation between efficiency and RNA structure calculated both computationally and from recent structure probing data, as well as the Kozak initiation motif, which may comprise a mechanism to regulate initiation. Overall design: We test whether tRNA abundance affects elongation or translation efficiency by changing the tRNA levels through deletion or over expression and measuring the ribosomal dwell time at each codon using a robust statistical method that accounts for flow conservation."

PRJNA266705,Widespread Co-translational RNA Decay Reveals Ribosome Dynamics,"It is generally assumed that mRNAs undergoing translation are protected from decay. Here, we show that mRNAs are, in fact, co-translationally degraded. This is a widespread and conserved process affecting most genes, where 5'–3' transcript degradation follows the last translating ribosome, producing an in vivo ribosomal footprint. By sequencing the ends of 5' phosphorylated mRNA degradation intermediates, we obtain a genome-wide drug-free measurement of ribosome dynamics. We identify general translation termination pauses in both normal and stress conditions. In addition, we describe novel codon-specific ribosomal pausing sites in response to oxidative stress that are dependent on the RNase Rny1. Our approach is simple and straightforward and does not require the use of translational inhibitors or in vitro RNA footprinting that can alter ribosome protection patterns. Overall design: RNA samples were quantified according to their 5’modification. Samples were quantified using 2 alternative methods. 5PSeq (measures 5’P RNAs) and 5PSeq-fragmented (measures the sequencing bias present in any sample by randomly fragmenting RNA, re-phosphorilating the 5’ends and subjecting the sample to 5PSeq; it is used as a negative control). Different strains of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe samples were analyzed. Cells were grown both in rich media (YPD or YES) and synthetic defined media (SD). Cells were subjected to different treatments such as inhibition of translation elongation with cyclohexamide (CHX), oxidative stress (0.2 mM H2O2) or inhibition of histidine biosyntesys (3-AT; 100mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole).

PRJEB7207,"We monitored translation at nucleotide resolution in a genome-wide high throughput manner, using ribosome profiling on the murine C2C12 cell line, a model for skeletal muscle differentiation. We simplified the existing protocol and developed a data analysis pipeline to characterize translation initiation during differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, to detect switches in the use of alternative translation initiation sites, as well as to quantify translation.","The formation of skeletal muscles is associated with drastic changes in protein requirements. These changes are safeguarded by tight control over transcription and mRNA processing. The importance of translational control is currently less clear. Regulation at translational level may affect both abundance and protein identity. Use of alternative translation initiation sites (TISs) in upstream open reading frames (uORFs) may increase or decrease protein synthesis, whereas alternative open reading frames (aORFs) produce different proteins.  We applied ribosome profiling to monitor translation during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. We simplified the existing protocol and developed a dedicated pipeline to identify TISs and quantify translation activity. We identified 5333 unannotated TISs, providing a catalogue of alternative TISs leading to uORFs and aORFs. By comparing ribosome profiling and DeepCAGE data, we found 312 genes that switched to an alternative TIS, not explained by alternative promoter usage. Many of these genes were ribosomal protein genes and genes involved in calcium signaling. The same pathways demonstrated discrepant total RNA and ribosome-associated RNA levels. Our data suggest that ribosome biogenesis and calcium signaling are most strongly regulated at the translational level, while the majority of differences in protein requirements during myogenesis are ensured by changes at transcriptional level."

These strains are compromised for gene regulation, ribosome assembly, transport and/or respiration, indicating that LepA contributes to these functions in some way. We also use ribosome profiling to deduce the effects of LepA on translation. We find that loss of LepA alters the average ribosome density (ARD) for hundreds of mRNA coding regions in the cell, substantially reducing ARD in many cases. By contrast, only subtle and codon-specific changes in ribosome distribution along mRNA are seen. These data suggest that LepA contributes mainly to the initiation phase of translation. Consistent with this interpretation, the effect of LepA on ARD is related to the sequence of the Shine-Dalgarno region. Global perturbation of gene expression in the ?lepA mutant likely explains most of its phenotypes."
PRJNA263582,Cell fate determination by ubiquitin-dependent regulation of translation,"Metazoan development depends on accurate execution of differentiation programs that allow pluripotent stem cells to adopt specific fates. Differentiation is brought about by global changes to chromatin architecture and transcriptional networks, yet whether other regulatory events support cell fate determination is less well understood. Using human embryonic stem cell and Xenopus models, we identified the vertebrate-specific ubiquitin ligase Cul3KBTBD8 as an essential regulator of neural crest specification. Cul3KBTBD8 monoubiquitylates NOLC1 and its paralog TCOF1, whose mutation underlies the craniofacial disorder Treacher Collins Syndrome that is characterized by a loss of cranial neural crest cells. Ubiquitylation of NOLC1 and TCOF1 drives formation of a platform that connects RNA polymerase I with ribosome modification enzymes, thereby altering the translational program of differentiating cells to support the generation of neural crest cells. We conclude that the dynamic regulation of ribosome function is an important feature of cell fate determination. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and mRNA-Seq"
PRJNA263261,HuR- dependent regulation of mRNA splicing is essential for the B cell antibody response [Ribo-Seq],"Post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA by the RNA binding protein HuR is required in B cells for the germinal centre reaction and for the production of class-switched antibodies in response to T-independent antigens. Transcriptome-wide examination of RNA isoforms, abundance and translation in HuR-deficient B cells, together with direct measurements of HuR-RNA interaction,  revealed that HuR-dependent mRNA splicing affects hundreds of transcripts including the dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (Dlst), a subunit of the aketoglutaratedehydrogenase (aKGDH) enzyme. In the absence of HuR, defective mitochondrial metabolism results in high levels of reactive oxygen species and B cell death. Our study shows how post-transcriptional processes control the balance of energy metabolism required for B cell proliferation and differentiation. Overall design: Sequencing analysis of ribosome protected RNA fragments in ex vivo or LPS-activated splenic B cells was performed using ARTseq™ Ribosome Profiling Kit - Mammalian (Epicentre, RPHMR12126) and Illumina platform. Splenic B cells come from HuRf/f control or HuR cKO mice. 4-5 biological replicates per genotype and condition."
PRJNA262909,m6A mRNA Methylation Facilitates Resolution of Naïve Pluripotency Towards Differentiation (Ribo-seq),"Naïve and primed pluripotent states retain distinct molecular properties, yet limited knowledge exists on how their state transitions are regulated. Here we identify Mettl3, an N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) transferase, as a regulator for terminating murine naïve pluripotency. Mettl3 knockout pre-implantation epiblasts and naïve embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are depleted for m6A in mRNAs and yet, are viable. However, they fail to adequately terminate their naïve state, and subsequently undergo aberrant and restricted lineage priming at the post-implantation stage, leading to early embryonic lethality. m6A predominantly and directly reduces mRNA stability, including that of key naïve pluripotency promoting transcripts. This study highlights a critical role for an mRNA epigenetic modification in vivo, and identifies regulatory modules that functionally influence naïve and primed pluripotency in an opposing manner. Overall design: Ribosome footprint (Ribo-Seq) was measured from mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse embriod bodies, in WT and Mettl3-KO cell lines."
PRJNA262036,The ribosomal protein Asc1/RACK1 is required for efficient translation of short mRNAs,"Translation is a core cellular process carried out by a highly conserved macromolecular machine, the ribosome. There has been remarkable evolutionary adaptation of this machine through the addition of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins whose individual effects on ribosome function are largely unknown. Here we show that eukaryote-specific Asc1/RACK1 is required for efficient translation of mRNAs with short open reading frames that show greater than average translational efficiency in diverse eukaryotes. ASC1 mutants in S. cerevisiae display compromised translation of specific functional groups, including cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and display cellular phenotypes consistent with their gene-specific translation defects. Asc1-sensitive mRNAs are preferentially associated with the translational ‘closed loop’ complex comprised of eIF4E, eIF4G and Pab1, and depletion of eIF4G mimics the translational defects of ASC1 mutants. Together our results reveal a role for Asc1/RACK1 in a length-dependent initiation mechanism optimized for efficient translation of genes with important housekeeping functions. Overall design: Ribosome footprint profiling and matched RNA-Seq was performed on S. cerevisiae mutants with altered Asc1 function or expression. Data from additional ribosomal protein mutants, rpl23b?, rpp1a?, rps0b?, and rps16b?, was collected for comparison. Data was also collected from an ASC1 protein null mutant, asc1-M1X, in a stress condition (growth in glycerol-containing media). In each case, data was collected from two biological replicates. Supplementary processed data files linked below: abbreviations: FP= ribosome footprint profiling total= total RNA-Seq TE= translation efficiency measurements glycerol= yeast grown in rich media containing glycerol instead of glucose rz= libraries made using Ribo-Zero rRNA subtraction rather than polyA selection reprep= library made from the same biological replicate starting material, as noted, in order to obtain higher read coverage.

PRJNA262009,Impact of regulatory variation from RNA to protein,"Genetic variants that impact gene regulation are important contributors to human phenotypic variation. For this reason, considerable efforts have been made to identify genetic associations with differences in mRNA levels of nearby genes, namely, cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The phenotypic consequences of eQTLs are presumably due, in most cases, to their ultimate effects on protein expression levels. Yet, only few studies have quantified the impact of genetic variation on proteins levels directly. It remains unclear how faithfully eQTLs are reflected at the protein level, and whether there is a significant layer of cis regulatory variation acting primarily on translation or steady state protein levels. To address these questions, we measured ribosome occupancy by high-throughput sequencing, and relative protein levels by high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, in a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in which we had previously measured transcript expression using RNA sequencing. We then mapped genetic variants that are associated with changes in transcript expression (eQTLs), ribosome occupancy (rQTLs), or protein abundance (pQTLs). Most of the QTLs we detected are associated with transcript expression levels, with consequent effects on ribosome and protein levels. However, we found that eQTLs tend to have significantly reduced effect sizes on protein levels, suggesting that their potential impact on downstream phenotypes is often attenuated or buffered. Additionally, we confirmed the presence of a class of cis QTLs that specifically affect protein abundance with little or no effect on mRNA levels; most of these QTLs have little effect on ribosome occupancy, and hence may arise from differences in post-translational regulation. Overall design: We measured level of translation transcriptome-wide in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 72 HapMap Yoruba individuals using ribosome profiling assay, for which we have transcript level, protein level (62 out of 72) and genotype information collected."
PRJNA261698,The general mode of translation inhibition by macrolide antibiotics,"Macrolides are clinically important antibiotics thought to inhibit bacterial growth by impeding the passage of newly synthesized polypeptides through the nascent peptide exit tunnel of the bacterial ribosome. Recent data challenged this view by showing that macrolide antibiotics can differentially affect synthesis of individual proteins. In order to understand the general mechanism of macrolide action, we used genome-wide ribosome profiling and analyzed the redistribution of ribosomes translating highly expressed genes in bacterial cells treated with high concentrations of macrolide antibiotics. The metagene analysis indicated that inhibition of early rounds of translation, which would be characteristic of the conventional view of macrolide action, occurs only at a limited number of genes. Translation of most genes proceeds past the 5'' proximal codons and can be arrested at more distal codons when the ribosome encounters specific short sequence motifs. The sequence motifs enriched in the sites of arrest are confined to the nascent peptide residues in the peptidyl transferase center but not to the peptide segments that contact the antibiotic molecule in the exit tunnel. This led to the conclusion that the general mode of macrolide action involves selective inhibition of peptide bond formation between specific combinations of donor and acceptor substrates. Additional factors operating in the living cell but not during in vitro protein synthesis may modulate site-specific action of macrolide antibiotics. Overall design: Comparing ribosome distribution in bacterial cells treated with macrolide antibiotics against the control cells."

PRJNA260933,Trypanosoma cruzi DM28c Transcriptome or Gene expression,"Due to the absence of transcription regulation of protein coding genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, post transcriptional regulation is responsible for the majority of gene expression changes in trypanosomatids. Therefore, cataloging the abundance of mRNAs (transcriptome) and the level of their translation (translatome) is a key factor to understand control of gene expression in these organisms. Here we assess the extent of regulation of transcription and translation in the Chagas disease causing agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, at both the non-infective (epimastigote) and infective (metacyclic trypomastigote) life stages using RNA-seq and ribosome profiling. The observed steady state transcript levels support pervasive transcription and maturation implying the existence of distinctive post transcriptional regulatory mechanisms acting at those parasite stages. Meanwhile, the down regulation of a large proportion of the translatome indicates a key role of translation control in differential gene expression. The previously described proteomic data correlate better with the translatomes than with the transcriptomes and translational efficiency analysis shows a wide dynamic range, reinforcing the importance of translatability as a regulatory step. Efficiencies for protein families like ribosomal components are diminished while translation of the transialidase virulence factors is up regulated in the quiescent infective metacyclic trypomastigote stage. Globally this study highlights translational regulation as a major factor during the parasite differentiation."

PRJNA260073,Principles of ER Co-Translational Translocation Revealed by Proximity-Specific Ribosome Profiling,"Localized protein synthesis is a fundamental mechanism for creating distinct subcellular environments. Here we developed a generalizable proximity-specific ribosome profiling strategy that enables global interrogation of translation in defined subcellular locations. We applied this approach to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in yeast and mammals. We observed the vast majority of secretory proteins to be co-translationally translocated, including substrates capable of post-translational insertion in vitro. Distinct translocon complexes engaged nascent chains at different points during synthesis. Whereas most proteins engaged the ER immediately following or even before signal sequence (SS) emergence, a class of Sec66-dependent proteins entered with a looped SS conformation. Finally, we observed rapid ribosome exchange into the cytosol following translation termination. These data provide insights into how distinct translocation mechanisms act in concert to promote efficient co-translational recruitment.

PRJNA260072,Targeting and Plasticity of Mitochondrial Proteins Revealed by Proximity-Specific Ribosome Profiling,"Nearly all mitochondrial proteins are nuclear-encoded and are targeted to their mitochondrial destination from the cytosol. Here, we used proximity-specific ribosome profiling to comprehensively measure translation at the mitochondrial surface in yeast. The majority of inner membrane proteins were co-translationally targeted to mitochondria, reminiscent of proteins entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Comparison between mitochondrial and ER localization demonstrated that the vast majority of proteins were targeted to a specific organelle. A prominent exception was the fumarate reductase Osm1, known to reside in mitochondria. We identified a conserved ER isoform of Osm1, which contributes to the oxidative protein folding capacity of the organelle. This dual localization was enabled by alternative translation initiation sites encoding distinct targeting signals. These findings highlight the exquisite in vivo specificity of organellar targeting mechanisms.

PRJNA259844,Genome-wide translational analysis of RAW264 macrophages by ribosome profiling,"Purpose: The aim is to analyze the translational kinetics of the basal and LPS-stimulated conditions of RAW264 macrophages focusing on ribosome density Method: RAW264 macrophages were cultured at 3.0 x 10^5 cells/ml in media (DMEM, 2mM Glutamine, 10% FBS, 100 units penicillin and 100µg streptomycin/mL) 24 hours prior to harvest. It was confirmed that the confluency of cells never surpassed 80 ~ 90%.  Cell were harvested in their basal state or LPS stimulated condition (100 ng/ml for 30 min) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) and high-throughput mRNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq) were conducted. Ribosome protected fragments (RPF) were sequenced and the density was normalized by mRNA abundance. Result and conclusion: We discovered where in the ribosome translational arrest ocurs and how this happens. Translational stall was striking at A-site and P-site of ribosomal complex. The other arrest site was observed 3 to 5 residues away from the peptidyl transfer center of the exit tunnel, in which ribosomal density and hydrophobicity showed a significant negative correlation.

PRJNA259424,Time resolved ribosome profiling study of oxygen and glucose deprivation of rat pheochromocytoma cells,"Oxygen and glucose metabolism plays a pivotal role in many (patho)physiological conditions. In particular, oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) occurs during ischemia and stroke, resulting in extensive tissue injury and cell death. We applied time-resolved ribosome profiling technique to assess early events at the level of gene expression in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells during short-term OGD. Most substantial alterations in transcripts levels and their translation were seen to occur in the first 20 minutes of OGD. The rapid adaptation of translation apparatus to OGD is global and involves altered elongation and initiation rates. We also observed salient and reproducible alterations in ribosome densities of individual mRNAs such as increased translation of particular upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs); induced site-specific arrests of the ribosomes and synthesis of extended protein isoforms. Overall design: Ribosome profiling (with mRNA-seq sequencing) was carried out at 0,20,40 and 60 minutes of OGD. Two biological replicates were used."

PRJNA257463,Ribosome Profiling Reveals Pervasive Translation Outside of Annotated Protein-Coding Genes,"Ribosome profiling suggests that ribosomes occupy many regions of the transcriptome thought to be non-coding, including 5' UTRs and lncRNAs. Apparent ribosome footprints outside of protein-coding regions raise the possibility of artifacts unrelated to translation, particularly when they occupy multiple, overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Here we show hallmarks of translation in these footprints: co-purification with the large ribosomal subunit, response to drugs targeting elongation, trinucleotide periodicity, and initiation at early AUGs. We develop a metric for distinguishing between 80S footprints and nonribosomal sources using footprint size distributions, which validates the vast majority of footprints outside of coding regions. We present evidence for polypeptide production beyond annotated genes, including induction of immune responses following human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Translation is pervasive on cytosolic transcripts outside of conserved reading frames, and direct detection of this expanded universe of translated products enables efforts to understand how cells manage and exploit its consequences.

PRJNA255669,Translation Inhibitors Cause Abnormalities in Ribosome Profiling Experiments,"Ribosome profiling and high-throughput sequencing provide unprecedented opportunities for the analysis of mRNA translation. Using this novel method, several studies have demonstrated the widespread role of short upstream reading frames in translational control as well as slower elongation at the beginning of open reading frames in response to stress. Based on the initial studies, the importance of adding or omitting translation inhibitors, such as cycloheximide, was noted as it markedly affected ribosome coverage profiles. For that reason, many recent studies omitted translation inhibitors in the culture medium. Here, we investigate the influence of ranging cycloheximide concentrations on ribosome profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate that increasing the drug concentration can overcome some of the artifacts. We subjected cells to various manipulations and show that neither oxidative stress nor heat shock nor amino acid starvation affect translation elongation. Instead, the observations in the initial studies are the result of cycloheximide-inflicted artifacts. Likewise, we find little support for short upstream reading frames to be involved in wide-spread protein synthesis regulation under stress conditions. Our study highlights the need for better standardization of ribosome profiling methods.

The normal function of DDX3X is poorly understood, and the consequences of its cancer-associated mutations have not been explored. Here we used genomic, biochemical, cell biological, and animal modeling approaches to investigate normal DDX3X function and the impact of cancer-associated DDX3X mutations. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation–high-throughput sequencing (CLIPseq) analyses revealed that DDX3X binds primarily to ~1000 mature mRNA targets at binding sites spanning the full mRNA length; their enrichment in the coding regions suggests that DDX3X plays a role in translational elongation. The association of wild-type DDX3X with polysomes is consistent with this observation. Cancer-associated mutations result in loss of DDX3X from polysomes and accumulation of mutant DDX3X in stress granules (cytoplasmic accumulations of translationally arrested mRNAs). Mutation-dependent redistribution of DDX3X to stress granules is also observed in a Drosophila model system and in MB tumor cells from patients carrying DDX3X mutations. Importantly, mRNAs targeted by DDX3X are enriched in translation factors, suggesting that DDX3X regulates translation both directly and indirectly. Indeed, depletion of DDX3X by RNAi or over-expression of mutant DDX3X significantly impairs global protein synthesis. Ribosome profiling confirmed this observation and showed a 5’ bias in ribosomal occupancy, further confirming the role of DDX3X in translational elongation. Together, our data show that DDX3X is a key regulator of translation and that this function is impaired by cancer-associated mutations. Finally, we found that medulloblastoma-related mutant DDX3X can efficiently bind the wild-type form suggesting that mutant DDX3X could exert a dominant negative effect in vivo.

PRJNA253056,"MicL, a new σE-dependent sRNA, combats envelope stress by repressing synthesis of Lpp, the major outer membrane lipoprotein","In enteric bacteria, the transcription factor sE maintains membrane homeostasis by inducing expression of proteins involved in membrane repair and of two small, regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) that downregulate synthesis of abundant membrane porins. Here, we describe the discovery of a third sE-dependent sRNA, MicL, transcribed from a promoter located within the coding sequence of the cutC gene. MicL is synthesized as a 308 nt primary transcript that is processed to an 80 nt form. Both forms possess features typical of Hfq-binding sRNAs, but surprisingly only target a single mRNA, which encodes the outer membrane lipoprotein Lpp, the most abundant protein of the cell. We show that the copper sensitivity phenotype previously ascribed to inactivation of the cutC gene is actually derived from the loss of MicL and elevated Lpp levels. This observation raises the possibility that other phenotypes currently attributed to protein defects are due to deficiencies in unappreciated regulatory RNAs. We also report that sE activity is sensitive to Lpp abundance and that MicL and Lpp comprise a new sE regulatory loop that opposes membrane stress. Together MicA, RybB and MicL allow sE to repress the expression of all abundant outer membrane proteins in response to stress. Overall design: 12 samples mRNA-seq data, 2 samples ribosome profiling data.

PRJNA251988,Distinct stages of the translation elongation cycle revealed by sequencing ribosome-protected mRNA fragments,"During translation elongation, the ribosome ratchets along its mRNA template, incorporating each new amino acid and translocating from one codon to the next. The elongation cycle requires dramatic structural rearrangements of the ribosome. We show here that deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments reveals not only the position of each ribosome but also, unexpectedly, its particular stage of the elongation cycle. Sequencing reveals two distinct populations of ribosome footprints, 28-30 nucleotides and 20-22 nucleotides long, representing translating ribosomes in distinct states, differentially stabilized by specific elongation inhibitors. We find that the balance of small and large footprints varies by codon and is correlated with translation speed. The ability to visualize conformational changes in the ribosome during elongation, at single-codon resolution, provides a new way to study the detailed kinetics of translation and a new probe with which to identify the factors that affect each step in the elongation cycle. Overall design: Ribosome profiling, or sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments, in yeast. We assay ribosome footprint sizes and positions in three conditions: untreated yeast (3 replicates) and yeast treated with translation inhibitors cycloheximide (2 replicates) and anisomycin (2 biological replicates, one technical replicate). We also treat yeast with 3-aminotriazole to measure the effect of limited histidine tRNAs on ribosome footprint size and distribution (two treatment durations)."

We present the generation of a protein synthesis-based database from deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. This approach increases the overall protein identification rates with 3% and 11% (improved and new identifications) for human and mouse respectively and enables proteome-wide detection of 5’-extended proteoforms, uORF translation and near-cognate translation start sites.

PRJDB2681,Digital expression profiling of the compartmentalized translatome of Purkinje cells,"CAGEscan sequencing of the ribosome-associated RNA in rat Purkinje neurons in different subcellular compartments (cytoplasmic and membrane-bound compartments of the cell body and of dendrites) and two different conditions (control, induced long-term-depression). This dataset describes expression values together with precise 5'' transcription start sites in different subcellular compartments of rat Purkinje neurons. We used a mosaic AAV2/2-8 virus to introduce an EYFP-RPL10a construct specifically into Purkinje cells. The EYFP-tagged ribosomes were pulled-down together with all associated RNA, and then sequenced using the CAGEscan protocol [Plessy, C. et al. Linking promoters to functional transcripts in small samples with nanoCAGE and CAGEscan. Nature methods 7, 528-534 (2010)]. In addition RNA from the entire slice, without pull-down, was sequenced to enable a comparison of Purkinje-specific and nonspecific transcripts in the cerebellum."
PRJNA246542,Hepatic transcriptional signatures of exposure to oestradiol (E2) and the herbicide linuron in mature male brown trout,"These studies aimed to investigate the hepatic transcriptional response of brown trout to the natural estrogen, E2, and the herbicide linuron. We exposed mature male brown trout to three concentrations of each chemical for 4 days and sequenced the hepatic transcriptome of 3 individuals per treatment group in order to determine the global mechanisms of toxicity of these environmental contaminants. We assembled the brown trout transcriptome using a de novo approach. Subsequent differential expression analysis identified a total of 2113 differentially-regulated transcripts in the group exposed to the highest E2 treatment concentration, and 822 differentially-regulated transcripts across all linuron treatments. For E2, differentially-expressed transcripts included those encoding known oestrogen-responsive genes, while regulated processes included those associated with vitellogenesis including lipid metabolism, cellular proliferation and ribosome biogenesis. For linuron, there was a striking down-regulation of transcripts encoding the majority of the enzymes involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and also a considerable induction of transcripts involved in cellular stress response including Cyp1a. Overall design: Fish were exposed to 3 concentrations of E2 (measured concentrations were 1.9, 18.1 and 34.4 ng/L), 3 concentrations of linuron (measured concentrations were 1.7, 15.3 and 225.9 µg/L) and water controls for 4 days. Liver mRNA from 3 replicate individuals per treatment was sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Two control groups (n=6 fish in total) were included. Using a de novo approach, we assembled the hepatic transcriptome for brown trout. Sequence reads were re-mapped to the assembled transcriptome using Bowtie2 and transcript expression profiling was conducted using EdgeR. ERCC spike controls were added to all individual samples, allowing for the assessment of the reproducibility and dynamic range for transcript expression quantification in our experiments."
PRJNA246300,Stage-specific regulation of translation revealed by ribosome profiling of Trypanosoma brucei,"Trypanosoma brucei subspecies infect humans and animals in sub-Saharan Africa.  This early diverging eukaryote shows many novel features in basic biological processes, including the use of polycistronic transcription to generate all protein-coding mRNAs.  Therefore we hypothesized that translational control provides a means to tune gene expression during parasite development in mammalian and fly hosts. We used ribosome profiling to examine genome-wide protein production in animal-derived slender bloodstream forms and cultured procyclic (insect midgut) forms.  About one-third of all CDSs showed statistically significant regulation of protein production between the two stages.  Of these, more than two-thirds showed a change in translation efficiency, but few were controlled by this parameter alone.  Ribosomal proteins were translated poorly, especially in animal-derived parasites.  A disproportionate number of metabolic enzymes were up-regulated at the mRNA level in procyclic forms, as were variant surface glycoproteins in bloodstream forms.   Comparison with cultured bloodstream forms from another strain identified stage-specific changes in protein production that transcend strain and growth conditions.  Genes with upstream ORFs had a lower mean translation efficiency but no evidence was seen for involvement of these ORFs in stage-regulation. Ribosome profiling revealed that differences in the production of specific proteins in T. brucei slender bloodstream and procyclic forms are more common than anticipated from analysis of mRNA abundance.  While in vivo and in vitro derived slender bloodstream forms of different strains are more similar to one another than to procyclic forms, they showed numerous differences at both the mRNA and protein production level. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and mRNA libraries were constructed in triplicate from in vitro  PCF and in vivo  BF lifestages of theT. brucei Treu927 and in vitro T. brucei  Lister427, to evaluate role of translational gene regulation"
PRJNA245901,T-TRAP Profiling Reveals Dynamic Changes in the Transcriptome during Circuit Assembly,"Purpose: Communication between growth cones and their environment plays a central role in assembling neural circuits. We use Tandemly-Tagged Ribosome Affinity Purification (T-TRAP) of mRNA from R cells followed by RNA-seq for multiple time points during development to follow gene expression during target selection and synapse formation. Methods: We chose a ribosome trap method by modifying the N-terminus of the Drosophila ribosomal protein RpL10 with two tandemly arranged epitopes, 3X FLAG and GFP, separated by the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease site and expressed this in specific cell types using the GAL4/UAS system. cDNA libraries were prepared from mRNA associated with the affinity purified ribosomes and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000. We mapped raw reads to the D. melanogaster reference genome (release FB2013_01) with the gapped aligner Tophat. Only reads uniquely aligned were collected.Transcript expression levels were quantified using RPKM units using customized scripts written in Perl. Results: In this study, we observed massive changes in expression of cell surface proteins over short time scales (i.e. 5 fold differences in the expression of many hundreds of genes over 5 hr intervals) as R cell growth cones encounter the processes of many different neurons during their conversion from growth cones to synaptic terminals. In addition, to changes in transcripts encoding cell surface proteins, other mRNAs changed significantly as did non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) associated with ribosomes. Although dramatic changes in transcript levels of presynaptic proteins were not observed preceding the onset of synapse formation, marked changes in the 3''-untranslated regions of these transcripts were seen. Conclusions: These studies provide a step towards merging traditional genetic and global genomic approaches to understanding cellular recognition underlying the assembly of neural circuits. Overall design: We chose 7 time points for RNA-seq analysis of R cells during pupal development corresponding to 24, 35, 40, 45, 53, 65 and 96 hrs after pupal formation (APF)."
PRJNA245106,RNA-Seq and Ribosome Profiling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"High-throughput sequencing provides a method to globally analyze the transcriptome of an organism. We have employed several sequencing approaches to investigate the transcriptome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Strand-specific, random-primed RNA-Seq of whole-cell (rRNA-depleted) RNA from wild-type yeast was performed to measure steady-state gene expression and investigate both annotated and unannotated RNAs. To interrogate the translational state of all RNAs, RNA-Seq of RNAs which sediment with polyribosomes in a sucrose gradient (i.e. Polysome-Seq) was performed in parallel. This analysis was coupled with ribosome profiling, to identify the binding sites of ribosomes on distinct classes of RNAs at nucleotide-level resolution. Finally, RNA-seq performed on a mutant yeast strain deficient in the translation-dependent nonsense-mediated RNA decay pathway (NMD; upf1?) provided a functional readout for the translation of RNAs. Additionally, global identification of targets of this quality control pathway may allow the elucidation of NMD-targetting characteristics. This study will provide global information about the translational status of distinct classes of yeast RNAs and expand the understanding of how RNAs are targeted for NMD quality control."
PRJNA244941,Ribosome profiling reveals an important role for translational control in circadian gene expression,"Physiological and behavioral circadian rhythms are driven by a conserved transcriptional/translational negative feedback loop in mammals. Although most core clock factors are transcription factors, post-transcriptional control introduces delays that are critical for circadian oscillations. Little work has been done on circadian regulation of translation, so to address this deficit we conducted ribosome profiling experiments in a human cell model for an autonomous clock. We found that most rhythmic gene expression occurs with little delay between transcription and translation, suggesting that the lag in the accumulation of some clock proteins relative to their mRNAs does not arise from regulated translation. Nevertheless, we found that translation occurs in a circadian fashion for many genes, sometimes imposing an additional level of control on rhythmically expressed mRNAs and, in other cases, conferring rhythms on non-cycling mRNAs.  Most cyclically transcribed RNAs are translated at one of two major times in a 24h day, while rhythmic translation of most non-cyclic RNAs is phased to a single time of day. Unexpectedly, we found that the clock also regulates the formation of cytoplasmic processing (P) bodies, which control the fate of mRNAs, suggesting circadian coordination of mRNA metabolism and translation. Overall design: U2-OS cell time course over one day of 12 wildtype total RNA-seq samples, 12 wildtype ribosome profiling samples, 12 Bmal1 knockdown total RNA-seq samples and 12 Bmal1 knockdown ribosome profiling samples. All samples have duplicates."
PRJNA244865,RNA G-quadruplexes cause eIF4A-dependent oncogene translation in cancer,"The translational control of oncoprotein expression is implicated in many cancers. Here we report an eIF4A/DDX2 RNA helicase-dependent mechanism of translational control that contributes to oncogenesis and underlies the anticancer effects of Silvestrol and related compounds. For example, eIF4A promotes T-ALL development in vivo and is required for leukaemia maintenance. Accordingly, inhibition of eIF4A with Silvestrol has powerful therapeutic effects in vitro and in vivo. We use transcriptome-scale ribosome footprinting to identify the hallmarks of eIF4A-dependent transcripts. These include 5'UTR sequences such as the 12-mer guanine quartet (CGG)4 motif that can form RNA G-quadruplex structures. Notably, among the most eIF4A-dependent and Silvestrol-sensitive transcripts are a number of oncogenes, super-enhancer associated transcription factors, and epigenetic regulators. Hence, the 5'UTRs of selected cancer genes harbour a targetable requirement for the eIF4A RNA helicase. Overall design: Comparison of ribosome-protected RNA for drug treated and DMSO treated KOPT-K1 cell, two replicates of ribosome-protected RNA sequencing and three replicates of RNA-seq."

PRJNA244101,Ribosome profiling upon glucose starvation in S. cerevisiae,"A universal feature of the response to stress and nutrient limitation is transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding proteins important for survival.  Interestingly, under many of these conditions overall protein synthesis levels are reduced, thereby dampening the stress response at the level of protein expression. For example, during glucose starvation in yeast, translation is rapidly and reversibly repressed, yet transcription of many stress- and glucose-repressed genes is increased. Using ribosome profiling and microscopy, we found that this transcriptionally upregulated gene set consists of two classes: (1) one producing mRNAs that are preferentially translated during glucose limitation and are diffusely localized in the cytoplasm – this class includes many heat shock protein mRNAs; and (2) another producing mRNAs that are poorly translated during glucose limitation, have high rates of translation initiation, and are concentrated in foci that co-localize with P bodies and stress granules – this class is enriched for glucose metabolism mRNAs. Remarkably, the information specifying differential localization and translation of these two classes of mRNAs is encoded in the promoter sequence – promoter responsiveness to heat shock factor (Hsf1) specifies diffuse cytoplasmic localization and preferential translation upon glucose starvation, whereas different promoter elements upstream of genes encoding poorly translated glucose metabolism mRNAs direct these mRNAs to RNA granules under glucose starvation. Thus, promoter sequences and transcription factor binding can influence not only mRNA levels, but also subcellular localization of mRNAs and the efficiency with which they are translated, enabling cells to tailor protein production to environmental conditions. Overall design: Examination of mRNA translation in S. cerevisiae upon glucose starvation."

PRJNA243255,Correcting Direct Effects of Ethanol on Translation and Transcription Machinery Confers Ethanol Tolerance in Bacteria [Terminator_Readthrough_RNAseq],"The molecular mechanisms of ethanol toxicity and tolerance in bacteria, while important for biotechnology and bioenergy applications, remain incompletely understood. Genetic studies have identified potential cellular targets for ethanol and revealed multiple mechanisms of tolerance, but it remains difficult to separate direct and indirect effects of ethanol. We used adaptive evolution to generate spontaneous ethanol-tolerant strains of Escherichia coli, then characterized the mechanisms of toxicity and resistance associated with select mutations. Evolved alleles of metJ, rho, and rpsQ were sufficient to recapitulate much of the observed ethanol tolerance, implicating translation and transcription as key processes affected by ethanol. We found that ethanol induces mistranslation errors during protein synthesis, and that the evolved rpsQ allele protects cells by rendering the ribosome hyper-accurate. Ribosome profiling and RNAseq analyses of the ethanol-tolerant strain versus the wild type established that ethanol negatively affects transcriptional and translational processivity. Ethanol-stressed cells exhibited ribosomal stalling at internal AUG codons, which may be ameliorated by the adaptive inactivation of the MetJ repressor of methionine biosynthesis genes. Ethanol also caused aberrant intragenic transcription termination for mRNAs with low ribosome density, which was reduced in a strain with the adaptive rho mutation. Furthermore, ethanol inhibited transcript elongation by RNA polymerase in vitro. We propose that ethanol-induced inhibition and uncoupling of mRNA and protein synthesis are major contributors to ethanol toxicity in E. coli, and that adaptive mutations in metJ, rho, and rpsQ protect central dogma processes in the presence of ethanol. Overall design: RNA-seq comparison of wild-type and mutant strains to assess readthrough of Rho-dependent transcriptional terminators"

PRJNA243072,MicroRNA expression profiling of the fifth-instar posterior silk gland of Bombyx mori,"Background: The growth and development of the posterior silk gland and the biosynthesis of the silk core protein at the fifth larval instar stage of Bombyx mori are of paramount importance for silk production. Results: Here, aided by next-generation sequencing and microarry assay, we profile 1,229 microRNAs (miRNAs), including 728 novel miRNAs and 110 miRNA/miRNA* duplexes, from the posterior silk gland at the fifth larval instar. Target gene prediction yields 14,222 unique target genes from 1,195 miRNAs. Functional categorization classifies the genes into complex pathways that include both cellular and metabolic processes, especially protein synthesis and processing. Conclusion: The enrichment of target genes in the ribosome-related pathway indicates that miRNAs may directly regulate translation. Our findings pave a way for further functional elucidation of these miRNAs in silk production. Overall design: Sequencing 10 total RNA samples from the posterior silk gland of different strains and developmental stage using Illumina Solexa technology.  Four strains of silkworm (Q, B, QB and BQ) with different two development stages (stage 1: fourth instar molting to day 2 of fifth instar; stage 2: fifth instar day 3 to day 8 before spinning, according to our previous genes expression cluster analysis), and two strains (R1 and J1) from entire period (stage 1 + stage 2)."
PRJNA242628,"A novel IRES identified in DMD results in a functional N-truncated dystrophin, providing a potential route to therapy for patients with 5’ mutations.","Purpose: Ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq were used to map the location and abundance of translating ribosomes on human skeletal muscle transcripts from a patient with Becker muscular dystrophy. Methods: Tissue homogenates were prepared from frozen sections of a muscle biopsy obtained from a patient with an NM_004006:c.40_41delGA dystrophin mutation and a normal control.  Ribosome-protected fragments and total RNA were prepared from a single homogenate, so starting RNA populations for both libraries were closely matched.  Homogenates were not clarified before RNase digestion to avoid loss of ribosomes associated with large molecular weight complexes and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared after rRNA subtraction to avoid positional loss of 5’ reads.   RPF-Seq libraries were built using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and RNA-Seq libraries were built using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 Kit (Illumina). RPF-Seq and RNA-Seq libraries were subjected to 50 cycles of single-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument.  Trimmed and filtered RPF- and RNA-Seq reads were mapped to RefSeq fasta sequences downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (hg19 assembly). Results: Most mutations that truncate the reading frame of the DMD gene result in loss of dystrophin expression and lead to Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  However, amelioration of disease severity can result from alternate translation initiation beginning in DMD exon 6 that results in the expression of a highly functional N-truncated dystrophin.  This novel isoform results from usage of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) within exon 5 that is glucocorticoid-inducible. IRES activity is confirmed in patient muscle by both peptide sequencing and ribosomal profiling. Conclusions: Our results provide a molecular explanation for the rescue of 5’ truncating mutations via a heretofore undescribed mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of dystrophin expression. The presence of a glucocorticoid-inducible IRES within a highly conserved region of the DMD sequence strongly suggests a programmed role for alternate translation initiation, and ongoing efforts to understand the relevant cell lineage-specific and/or conditional activation signals will shed light on underlying mechanisms of IRES control and elucidate potentially novel functions of dystrophin. Overall design: Skeletal muscle ribosome-protected fragment and RNA-Seq profiles from a patient with an NM_004006:c.40_41delGA dystrophin mutation and a normal control were generated by deep sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2000."
PRJNA242520,Ribosome stalling induced by mutation of a CNS-specific tRNA causes neurodegeneration,"In higher eukaryotes, the large numbers of nuclear-encoded tRNA genes partially ensure the robustness of cytoplasmic protein translation. Here we discover that a loss-of-function in n-Tr20, a member of the nuclear-encoded tRNA Arg UCU family that is expressed specifically in the central nervous systems leads to low but detectable levels of ribosome stalling. In the absence of GTPBP2, a novel binding partner of the ribosome recycling protein Pelota, ribosome stalling increases, leading to widespread neurodegeneration. Our results not only define GTPBP2 as a ribosome rescue factor, but also unmask the disease potential of mutations in nuclear-encoded tRNA genes. In this submission we provide ribosome footprinting data from the cerebella of four strains derived from the C57BL/6J strain with combinations of  n-Tr20 and GTPBP2 mutations. Overall design: Examination of ribosome stalling in cerebella from 4 mouse strains derived from the: C57BL/6J (B6J) strain. The nmf205-/- strain has a homozygous mutation in the gene GTPBP2 while the B6J strain has normal GTPBP2. The n-Tr20 J/J strain has a defect in the n-Tr20 tRNA while the n-Tr20 N/N strain has a functional n-Tr20 tRNA. The 4 strains are the 2x2 combinations of these defects and correctly functioning sequences. 2 replicates for each strain. Please note that only BAM files are included in the records since they form the basis of the study''s conclusions.  The raw data ribosomal RNA have been filtered and then unique reads mapping to mm10 were computed using tophat and igenome annotations."

PRJNA239467,Ribosomal footprinting and RNASeq in two strains of yeast and their diploid hybrid,"Heritable differences in gene expression between individuals are an important source of phenotypic variation. The question of how closely the effects of genetic variation on protein levels mirror those on mRNA levels remains open. Here, we addressed this question by using ribosomal footprinting to examine how genetic differences between two strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae affect translation. Strain differences in translation were observed for hundreds of genes, more than half as many as showed genetic differences in mRNA levels. Similarly, allele specific measurements in the diploid hybrid between the two strains found roughly half as many cis-acting effects on translation as were observed for mRNA levels. In both the parents and the hybrid, strong effects on translation were rare, such that the direction of an mRNA difference was typically reflected in a concordant footprint difference. The relative importance of cis and trans acting variation on footprint levels was similar to that for mRNA levels. Across all expressed genes, there was a tendency for translation to more often reinforce than buffer mRNA differences, resulting in footprint differences with greater magnitudes than the mRNA differences. Finally, we catalogued instances of premature translation termination in the two yeast strains. Overall, genetic variation clearly influences translation, but primarily does so by subtly modulating differences in mRNA levels. Translation does not appear to create strong discrepancies between genetic influences on mRNA and protein levels. Overall design: Ribsosomal footprinting and RNASeq in the two yeast strains BY and RM as well as their diploid hybrid. We generated one library each for the BY and RM parents, and two libraries (biological replicates) for the hybrid data."
PRJNA238879,Ribosome profiling data obtained from HEK293T cells 30 minutes after treatment with arsenite to a final concentration of 40 µM,"Eukaryotic cells rapidly reduce protein synthesis in response to various stress conditions. This can be achieved by the phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of a key translation initiation factor, eIF2. However, the persistent translation of certain mRNAs is required for deployment of an adequate stress response. We carried out ribosome profiling of cultured human cells under conditions of severe stress induced with sodium arsenite. Although this led to a ~4.5-fold general translational repression, the protein coding ORFs of certain individual mRNAs exhibited resistance to the inhibition. Nearly all resistant transcripts possess at least one efficiently translated uORF that repress translation of the main coding ORF under normal conditions. Site specific mutagenesis of two identified stress resistant mRNAs (PPP1R15B and IFRD1) demonstrated that a single uORF is sufficient for eIF2-mediated translation control in both cases. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that at least two regulatory uORFs (namely in SLC35A4 and MIEF1) encode functional protein products. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of sodium arsenite treated cells for examination of translational response to induction of eIF2 phosphoylation"
PRJNA237963,The coding and noncoding architecture of the Caulobacter crescentus genome,"Caulobacter crescentus undergoes an asymmetric cell division controlled by a genetic circuit that cycles in space and time.  We provide a universal strategy for defining the coding potential of bacterial genomes by applying ribosome profiling, RNA-seq, global 5'-RACE, and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data to the 4-megabase C. crescentus genome.  We mapped transcript units at single base-pair resolution using RNA-seq together with global 5' RACE.  Additionally, using ribosome profiling and LC-MS, we mapped translation start sites and coding regions with near complete coverage.  We found most start codons lacked corresponding Shine-Dalgarno sites although ribosomes were observed to pause at internal Shine-Dalgarno sites within the ORF.  These data suggest a more prevalent use of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence for ribosome pausing rather than translation initiation in C. crescentus.  Overall 19% of the transcribed and translated genomic elements were newly identified or significantly improved by this approach providing a valuable genomic resource to elucidate the complete C. crescentus genetic circuitry that controls asymmetric cell division. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data were collected in Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 cells grown in M2G and PYE media to map transcript and ORF features in the genome."
PRJNA232843,Absolute quantification of protein production reveals principles underlying protein synthesis rates,"A quantitative view of cellular functions requires precise measures of the rates of biomolecule production, especially proteins-the direct effectors of biological processes. Here we present a genome-wide approach, based on ribosome profiling, for measuring absolute protein synthesis rates. The resultant E. coli dataset transforms our understanding of the extent to which protein synthesis is precisely controlled to optimize function and efficiency. For example, members of multi-protein complexes are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles used to optimize design. These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized for rapid response, and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements. More broadly, our studies reveal how general principles, important both for understanding natural systems and for synthesizing new ones, emerge from global quantitative analyses of protein synthesis.

PRJNA232779,Translational profiling in the unfolded protein response,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) couples cellular translation rates and gene expression to the protein folding status of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Upon activation, the UPR machinery elicits a general suppression of protein synthesis and activation of stress gene expression, which act coordinately to restore protein folding homeostasis. We report here that UPR activation promotes the release of signal sequence-encoding mRNAs from the ER to the cytosol as a mechanism to decrease protein influx into the ER.  This release of mRNA begins rapidly, then gradually recovers with ongoing stress. Upon release into the cytosol, these mRNAs have divergent fates: some synthesize full-length proteins, while others are translationally inactive and retain nascent protein chains. Together, these findings identify the dynamic subcellular localization of mRNAs and translation as a regulatory feature of the cellular response to protein folding stress. Overall design: Cells were treated with a timecourse of Thapsigargin or DTT, then fractionated and analyzed by mRNA-seq or ribosome profiling"
PRJNA232649,Identification of small ORFs in vertebrates using ribosome footprinting and evolutionary conservation,"Identification of the coding elements in the genome is a fundamental step to understanding the building blocks of living systems. Short peptides (< 100 aa) have emerged as important regulators of development and physiology, but their identification has been limited by their size. We have leveraged the periodicity of ribosome movement on the mRNA to define actively translated ORFs by ribosome footprinting. This approach identifies several hundred translated small ORFs in zebrafish and human. Computational prediction of small ORFs from codon conservation patterns corroborates and extends these findings and identifies conserved sequences in zebrafish and human, suggesting functional peptide products (micropeptides). These results identify micropeptide-encoding genes in vertebrates, providing an entry point to define their function in vivo.

PRJEB4784,Nutritional impact of a novel iron-containing protein meal on gastrointestinal tract functioning in larval zebrafish Danio rerio: characterisation of microbial communities and mRNAseq gene expression analysis,"Zebrafish has been explored as nutritional fish model with the purpose to assess the impact of two dietary inclusion levels of a novel iron-containing protein meal (IPM) of animal origin on the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of the developing zebrafish. The development of the microbial community has been assessed over the first 21 days post egg fertilisation (dpf) through 16S rRNA gene-based microbial composition profiling by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and pyrosequencing using a Genome Sequencer FLX. The molecular regulation of physiological processes by differentially expressed genes in the GIT is demonstrated at 21 dpf by whole transcriptome sequencing (mRNAseq) using an Illumina HiSeq2000 focusing on genes that are functionally involved in iron uptake and homeostasis.   Differential diet dependent phylogenetic diversity occurred. Larvae fed at high inclusion level of IPM differed from those fed at low level in early presence of Bacteroidetes, then an increase of Firmicutes and other phyla at the expense of the Actinobacteria. Finally with Firmicutes and Actinobacteria still present, Proteobacteria dominated. The abundance of Firmicutes in the larvae fed at high inclusion level of IPM at 14 and 21 dpf was much higher than those fed at low inclusion level which probably relates to their iron oxidizing capacity that may coincide with higher pH in the GIT. mRNAseq revealed that 328 genes were differentially expressed: expression of 214 genes was up-regulated and 114 genes down-regulated in larvae fed at high vs. low inclusion levels of IPM. Dominant gene groups representing ribosome components and activity and transport were up-regulated in the GIT of these larvae. 27 genes were identified as involved in iron homeostasis but were non-differentially expressed at a fold change 0.27 – 1.54. Functional classification of genes revealed that the GIT of larvae fed at higher IPM level are more active in transmembrane ion transport and protein synthesis. The marked differences in microbial constitution over time and gene expression reveal major impact of inclusion level of the novel IPM. These differences suggest that larvae fed at high inclusion level spend more energy on nutrient uptake and their innate immune response may be activated. The specific impact of iron level on the host-microbial symbiosis is indicated by the abundance of Firmicutes but not reflected by changes in expression of specific marker genes involved in iron homeostasis. Zebrafish can be applied as vertebrate and fish model to determine the nutritional impact on the microbial constitution and the GIT response."

PRJNA230577,Ribosome profiling study of dom34 and hbs1 knockout strains using short (16-nt) and long (28-nt) monosome-protected footprints and disome-protected footprints,"Ribosomes that stall before completing peptide synthesis must be recycled and returned to the cytoplasmic pool. The protein Dom34 and cofactors Hbs1 and Rli1 can dissociate stalled ribosomes in vitro, but the identity of targets in the cell is unknown. Here we use ribosome profiling methodology to reveal a high- resolution molecular characterization of Dom34 function in vivo. We show that Dom34 removes stalled ribosomes from mRNAs that are truncated but, in contrast, does not generally dissociate ribosomes on coding sequences known to trigger stalling, such as polyproline. We also show that Dom34 targets arrested ribosomes near the ends of 3 ´ UTRs. These ribosomes appear to gain access to the 3 ´ UTR via a mechanism that does not require decoding of the mRNA. These results suggest that Dom34 carries out the important task of rescuing ribosomes found in noncoding regions. Overall design: 25 samples are included in the study (2 mRNA-Seq samples and 23 ribosome footprint profiling samples). These include wild-type and dom34 or hbs1 knockout strains that were created in a variety of genetic backgrounds, treated with various agents in cell culture (e.g. diamide, 3-AT, or glucose starvation), treated differently during cell lysis (use of cycloheximide vs. other ribosome-stabilizing agents), or prepared in different ways after cell lysis (e.g. retention of short vs. long monosome-protected footprints or disome footprints)."

PRJNA230057,Polysome profiling and ribosome footprinting of Drosophila mature oocyte and activated egg,"We use mRNA-seq in combination with polysome profiling to determine translational status for all mRNAs in Drosophila mature oocytes and activated eggs. Puromycin-treated lysates are used as a negative control in polysome profiling experiments. Additionally, we use ribosome footprinting to globally measure translational efficiency of mRNAs in wild type mature oocytes as well as wild type and png mutant activated eggs. Overall design: Lysates of hand-dissected Drosophila mature oocytes  (containing ~540 µg of total RNA) were subjected to separation by velocity sedimentation through sucrose gradients. In this way, free mRNAs (present in RNPs fraction) or those comigrating with ribosomal subunits (40S or 60S+80S fractions) or with varying numbers of bound ribosomes (low polysomes (2-4 ribosomes), medium polysomes (5-9 ribosomes), and heavy polysomes (more than 10 ribosomes) can be separated based on their size and collected as sucrose gradient fractions. To compare quantitatively the levels of every mRNA across the polysome gradient fractions, we added 5ng of S. cerevisiae mRNA as an exogenous spike-in to each of the six fractions of interest: RNPs, 40S, 60S+80S, low polysomes, medium polysomes and heavy polysomes. RNA was extraced from these fractions, follwing proteinase K treatment, by hot acid phenol method.  In case of unfractionated lysates, RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. mRNA-seq samples were prepared from 1 µg of total RNA (in case of sucrose gradient fractions and unfractionated lysates) and subject to Illumina based sequencing. Puromycin-treated lysates of mature oocytes or 0-2h Drosophila activated  eggs (containing ~540 µg of total RNA) were also subjected to separation by velocity sedimentation through sucrose gradients. Puromycin causes premature termination of elongating ribosomes and thus it can be used to determine whether the mRNAs co-sedimenting with the polysomal peaks (defined here as =5 ribosomes) were actively engaged in translation. As an independent approach to assess translation and obtain information on the position of ribosomes on mRNAs, we employed ribosome footprinting. In addition to analyzing the same samples, as by polysome profiling, we also analyzed png mutant activated eggs by ribosome footprinting. Ribosome footprint profiling measures the number of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) derived from the mRNAs of each gene, resulting in a singular value of translational efficiency (TE) for each gene (TE=RPF/RNA)."
PRJNA229103,Transcriptome-wide mapping of human Staufen1 binding sites,"Purpose: We performed RNA-Immunoprecipitation in Tandem (RIPiT) experiments against human Staufen1 (Stau1) to identify its precise RNA binding sites in a transcriptome-wide manner. To monitor the consequences of Stau1 binding in terms of target mRNA levels and ribosome occupancy, we modified the levels of endogenous Stau1 in cells by siRNA or overexpression and performed RNA-sequencing and ribosome-footprinting experiments. Staufen1 (Stau1) is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein implicated in mRNA transport, regulation of translation, mRNA decay and stress granule homeostasis. Here we combined RNA-Immunoprecipitation in Tandem (RIPiT) with RNase footprinting, formaldehyde crosslinking, sonication-mediated RNA fragmentation and deep sequencing to map Staufen1 binding sites transcriptome-wide. We find that Stau1 binds complex secondary structures containing multiple short helices, many of which are formed by inverted Alu elements in annotated 3''UTRs or in strongly distal 3''UTRs extending far beyond the canonical polyadenylation signal. Stau1 also interacts with both actively translating ribosomes and with mRNA coding sequences (CDS) and 3''UTRs in proportion to their GC-content and internal secondary structure-forming propensity.  On mRNAs with high CDS GC-content, higher Stau1 levels lead to greater ribosome densities, suggesting a general role for Stau1 in modulating the ability of ribosomes to elongate through secondary structures located in CDS regions. Overall design: We used HEK293 cells expressing near endogenous levels of wild-type Flag-Stau1 (65KDa isoform with an N-Terminal Flag tag). As a control we used a mutant version of Stau1 that is not functional for dsRNA binding. Formaldehyde crosslinking experiments and RNase footprinting experiments were done in two biological replicates. All RNASeq, Ribosome footprinting and PAS-Seq were done in two biological replicates."
PRJNA227213,Extensive and coordinated control of allele-specific expression by both transcription and translation in Candida albicans,"Though sequence differences between alleles are often limited to a few polymorphisms, these differences can cause large and widespread allelic variation at the expression level. Such allele-specific expression (ASE) has been extensively explored at the level of transcription but not translation. Here we measured ASE in the diploid yeast Candida albicans at both the transcriptional and translational levels using RNA-seq and ribosome profiling, respectively. Since C. albicans is an obligate diploid, our analysis isolates ASE arising from cis elements in a natural, non-hybrid organism, where allelic effects reflect evolutionary forces. Importantly, we find that ASE arising from translation is of a similar magnitude as transcriptional ASE, both in terms of the number of genes affected and the magnitude of the bias. We further observe coordination between ASE at the levels of transcription and translation for single genes. Specifically, reinforcing relationships—where transcription and translation favor the same allele—are more frequent than expected by chance, consistent with selective pressure tuning ASE at multiple regulatory steps. Finally, we parameterize alleles based on a range of properties and find that SNP location and predicted mRNA-structure stability are associated with translational ASE in cis. Since this analysis probes more than 4,000 allelic pairs spanning a broad range of variations, our data provide a genome-wide view into the relative impacts of cis elements that regulate translation. Overall design: Two biological replicates of WT Candida albicans ribosome profiling and RNA-seq"
PRJNA223608,Expanded identification and characterization of mammalian circular RNAs,"The recent reports of two circular RNAs (circRNAs) with strong potential to act as microRNA (miRNA) sponges suggest that circRNAs might play important roles in regulating gene expression. However, the global properties of circRNAs are not well understood. We developed a computational pipeline to identify circRNAs and quantify their relative abundance from RNA-seq data. Applying this pipeline to a large set of non-poly(A)-selected RNA-seq data from the ENCODE project, we annotated 7,112 human circRNAs that were estimated to comprise at least 10% of the transcripts accumulating from their loci. Most circRNAs are expressed in only a few cell types and at low abundance, but they are no more cell-type–specific than are mRNAs with similar overall expression levels. Although most circRNAs overlap protein-coding sequences, ribosome profiling provides no evidence for their translation. We also annotated 635 mouse circRNAs, and although 20% of them are orthologous to human circRNAs, the sequence conservation of these circRNA orthologs is no higher than that of their flanking linear exons. The previously proposed miR-7 sponge, CDR1as, is one of only two circRNAs with more miRNA sites than expected by chance, with the next best miRNA-sponge candidate deriving from a primate-specific zinc-finger gene, ZNF91. These results provide a new framework for future investigation of this intriguing topological isoform while raising doubts regarding a biological function of most circRNAs. Overall design: Examination of 9 samples in 1 cell type Note: The ENCODE data we used are under GEO SuperSeries GSE26284 (all samples labeled _cell_total). But they were not used in the processing of the U2OS data."

PRJNA219750,An Integrated Approach Reveals Regulatory Controls on Bacterial Translation Elongation,"Ribosomes elongate at a nonuniform rate during translation. Theoretical models and experiments disagree on the in vivo determinants of elongation rate and the mechanism by which elongation rate affects protein levels. To resolve this conflict, we measured transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy under multiple conditions and used it to formulate a whole-cell model of translation in E. coli. Our model predicts that elongation rates at most codons during nutrient-rich growth are not limited by the intracellular concentrations of aminoacyl-tRNAs. However, elongation pausing during starvation for single amino acids is highly sensitive to the kinetics of tRNA aminoacylation. We further show that translation abortion upon pausing accounts for the observed ribosome occupancy along mRNAs during starvation. Abortion reduces global protein synthesis, but it enhances the translation of a subset of mRNAs. These results suggest a regulatory role for aminoacylation and abortion during stress, and our study provides an experimentally constrained framework for modeling translation. Overall design: 7 samples for ribosome profiling and 4 samples for total mRNA profiling"
PRJNA219480,MAEL-dependent selective processing of pachytene piRNA precursors and translation of spermiogenic mRNAs,"Piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) of fetal prospermatogonia of mice have been strongly implicated in transposon control. In contrast, little is known about biogenesis and function of abundant piRNAs from adult testes expressed in late spermatocytes and round spermatids. These so-called pachytene piRNAs are processed from long non-coding piRNA precursors and have no defined RNA targets in the transcriptome even though their binding partner Piwi, MIWI, is essential for spermiogenesis and fertility. Here we report that 129SvJae mice lacking Maelstrom (MAEL), a conserved piRNA pathway protein, exhibit spermiogenic arrest with defects in acrosome and flagellum formation. Further analysis revealed MAEL association with RNPs containing MIWI, TDRD6, and processed  intermediates of pachytene piRNA precursors of various length. Loss of MAEL causes a 10-fold drop in pachytene piRNA levels but an increase in piRNAs from abundantly expressed mRNAs. These results suggest a MAEL-dependent mechanism for the selective processing of pachytene piRNA precursor into piRNAs. Strikingly, ribosome profiling of Mael-null testes revealed that reduced piRNA production is accompanied by reduced translation of over 800 spermiogenic mRNAs including those encoding acrosome and flagellum proteins. In light of recent reports of piRNA-independent protection of translationally repressed mRNPs by MIWI and piRNA-dependent turnover of MIWI, we propose that pachytene piRNAs function by controlling the availably of MIWI for the translational repression of spermiogenic mRNAs. Overall design: piRNA sequencing, RNA immunoprecipitation, and expression measurements (RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling) in wild-type and Mael -/- testes"
PRJNA219205,A Serine Sensor for Multicellularity in a Bacterium,"We report the discovery of a simple environmental sensing mechanism for biofilm formation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis that operates without the involvement of a dedicated RNA or protein. Certain serine codons, the four TCN codons, in the gene for the biofilm repressor SinR caused a lowering of SinR levels under biofilm-inducing conditions. Synonymous substitutions of these TCN codons with AGC or AGT impaired biofilm formation and gene expression. Conversely, switching AGC or AGT to TCN codons upregulated biofilm formation. Genome-wide ribosome profiling showed that ribosome density was higher at UCN codons than at AGC or AGU during biofilm formation. Serine starvation recapitulated the effect of biofilm-inducing conditions on ribosome occupancy and SinR production. As serine is one of the first amino acids to be exhausted at the end of exponential phase growth, reduced translation speed at serine codons may be exploited by other microbes in adapting to stationary phase. Overall design: 4 samples for ribosome profiling and 2 samples for total mRNA profiling"

PRJNA214890,A long noncoding RNA protects the heart from pathological hypertrophy,"The role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in adult hearts is unknown; also unclear is how lncRNA modulates nucleosome remodelling. An estimated 70% of mouse genes undergo antisense transcription1, including myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7), which encodes molecular motor proteins for heart contraction2. Here we identify a cluster of lncRNA transcripts from Myh7 loci and demonstrate a new lncRNA–chromatin mechanism for heart failure. In mice, these transcripts, which we named myosin heavy-chain-associated RNA transcripts (Mhrt), are cardiac-specific and abundant in adult hearts. Pathological stress activates the Brg1–Hdac–Parp chromatin repressor complex3 to inhibit Mhrt transcription in the heart. Such stress-induced Mhrt repression is essential for cardiomyopathy to develop: restoring Mhrt to the pre-stress level protects the heart from hypertrophy and failure. Mhrt antagonizes the function of Brg1, a chromatin-remodelling factor that is activated by stress to trigger aberrant gene expression and cardiac myopathy3. Mhrt prevents Brg1 from recognizing its genomic DNA targets, thus inhibiting chromatin targeting and gene regulation by Brg1. It does so by binding to the helicase domain of Brg1, a domain that is crucial for tethering Brg1 to chromatinized DNA targets. Brg1 helicase has dual nucleic-acid-binding specificities: it is capable of binding lncRNA (Mhrt) and chromatinized—but not naked—DNA. This dual-binding feature of helicase enables a competitive inhibition mechanism by which Mhrt sequesters Brg1 from its genomic DNA targets to prevent chromatin remodelling. A Mhrt–Brg1 feedback circuit is thus crucial for heart function. Human MHRT also originates from MYH7 loci and is repressed in various types of myopathic hearts, suggesting a conserved lncRNA mechanism in human cardiomyopathy. Our studies identify a cardioprotective lncRNA, define a new targeting mechanism for ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling factors, and establish a new paradigm for lncRNA–chromatin interaction.

By using crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, we have identified over 4000 substrate RNA of YTHDF2 with conserved core motif of G(m6A)C. We further estabilshed the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism by a combination of ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, m6A level quantification and cell-based imaging: the C-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m6A of mRNA and the N-terminal domain is responsive for localizing mRNA from translatable pool to processing body where mRNA decay occurs. Overall design: PAR-CLIP and RIP was used to identify YTHDF2 binding sites followed by ribosome profling and RNA seq to assess the consequences of YTHDF2 siRNA knock-down"
PRJNA213618,The Transcriptional Stress Response of Candida albicans to Weak Organic Acids,"Candida albicans is the most important fungal pathogen of humans, causing severe infections especially in nosocomial and immunocompromised settings.  However, it is also the most prevalent fungus of the normal human microbiome, where it shares its habitat with hundreds of trillions of other microbial cells.  Despite weak organic acids (WOAs) being among the most abundant metabolites produced by bacterial microbiota, little is known about their effect on C. albicans.  Here we employed a sequencing-based profiling strategy to systematically investigate the transcriptional stress response of C. albicans to lactic, acetic, propionic and butyric acid at several time points after treatment.  Our data reveal a complex transcriptional response, with individual WOAs triggering unique gene expression profiles and with important differences between acute and chronic exposure.  In spite of all these dissimilarities, we found significant overlaps between the gene expression changes induced by each WOA, which lead us to uncover a core transcriptional signature that was unrelated to the general response to low pH.  Genes commonly up-regulated by WOAs were enriched in several iron transporters, which was associated with an overall decrease in intracellular iron concentrations.  Moreover, chronic exposure to any WOA lead to down-regulation of RNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis genes, which resulted in significant reduction of total RNA levels in general and of ribosomal RNA in particular.  In conclusion, this study suggests that GI microbiota might directly influence C. albicans physiology via production of WOAs, with possible implications of how this fungus interacts with its hosts in both health and disease. Overall design: Transcriptional profiling of wild-type Candida albicans strain SC5314 under 6 differents condition (2 controls, 4 weak acids) at 4 time points by cDNA deep-sequencing, with 4 biological replicates, on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. 96 total samples were sequenced (6 x 4 x 4)."
PRJNA213294,Ribosome profiling reveals pervasive and regulated stop codon readthrough  in Drosophila melanogaster,"Ribosomes can read through stop codons in a regulated manner, elongating rather than terminating the nascent peptide. Stop codon readthrough is essential to diverse viruses, and phylogenetically predicted to occur in a few hundred genes in Drosophila melanogaster, but the importance of regulated readthrough in eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a ribosome profiling assay (deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) for Drosophila melanogaster, and provide the first genome-wide experimental analysis of readthrough. Readthrough is far more pervasive than expected: the vast majority of readthrough events evolved within D. melanogaster and were not predicted phylogenetically. The resulting C-terminal protein extensions show evidence of selection, contain functional subcellular localization signals, and their readthrough is regulated, arguing for their importance. We further demonstrate that readthrough occurs in yeast and humans. Readthrough thus provides general mechanisms both to regulate gene expression and function, and to add plasticity to the proteome during evolution.

PRJNA211752,Global response to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis,"Here we use an integrated systems-level examination of transcription, translation, and proteolysis to explore how cancer cells struggle with a chemotherapeutic drug prior to succumbing to apoptosis. As a model system we study myeloma cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a first-line clinical treatment. Despite robust transcriptional changes, unbiased quantitative proteomics detects production of only a few critical anti-apoptotic proteins against a background of general translation inhibition. Ribosome profiling further reveals potential translational regulation of stress response genes following bortezomib treatment. Once the apoptotic machinery is engaged, degradation by caspases is largely independent of changes at the transcriptional level. Moreover, previously uncharacterized non-caspase proteolytic events also participate in cellular deconstruction. As suggested by these data, we find that inhibition of the anti-apoptotic response regulator HSF1 promotes cell death by bortezomib. Thus, monitoring global cellular dynamics after chemotherapy offers in-depth insight into apoptosis and can also guide potential therapeutic combinations. Overall design: We examined MM1.S myeloma cells exposed to 20 nM bortezomib across a time course with independent samples of poly(A) mRNA and ribosome footprints isolated at each of six time points (0h (untreated), 1.5h, 3h, 6h, 9h, 12h).

PRJNA206070,"Nanog, SoxB1 and Pou5f1/Oct4 regulate widespread zygotic gene activation during the maternal-to-zygotic transition","Upon fertilization, maternal factors direct development in a transcriptionally silent embryo. At the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), a universal step in animal development, unknown maternal factors trigger zygotic genome activation (ZGA). In zebrafish, ZGA is required for gastrulation and clearance of maternal mRNAs, which is achieved in part by the conserved microRNA miR-430. However, the precise factors that activate the zygotic program remain largely unknown. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required for genome activation in zebrafish. We identified several hundred genes directly activated by maternal factors, thus constituting the first wave of zygotic transcription in zebrafish. Ribosome profiling in the pre-MZT embryo revealed that nanog, sox19b and pou5f1 are the most highly translated transcription factor mRNAs. Combined loss of function for Nanog, SoxB1 and Pou5f1 resulted in developmental arrest prior to gastrulation, and a failure to activate >75% of zygotic genes. Furthermore, we found that Nanog binds the miR-430 locus and together with Pou5f1 and SoxB1 initiate miR-430 expression and activity. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and in turn trigger the clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression.

PRJNA205933,High resolution view of bacteriophage lambda gene expression by ribosome profiling,"Bacteriophage lambda is one of the most extensively studied organisms, and has been a primary model for understanding basic modes of genetic regulation.  Here we examine the progress of lambda gene expression during phage development by ribosome profiling, and thereby provide a very high resolution view of lambda gene expression.  The known genes are expressed in a predictable fashion, authenticating the analysis.  But many previously unappreciated potential open reading frames become apparent in the expression analysis, revealing an unexpected complexity in the pattern of lambda gene function. Overall design: We chose temperature induction of the classic cI857 repressor mutation in a lysogen of E. coli MG1655 in order to synchronize the lytic process, sampling the lysogen and control non-lysogen both before and 2, 5, 10, and 20 minutes after shifting the temperature from 32° to 42°.  The last sample time was chosen to be before any significant cell lysis, but during the later stages of lytic gene expression. Total protected nucleotides within open reading frames were summed to determine the density of translation of each reading frame.  We take this number to indicate the overall rate of translation, although obviously this assumes that pauses in translation do not excessively affect the overall rate.  Since the expression level is not normalized for the copy number of the replicating phage DNA, it thus encompasses both the effect of DNA template availability on mRNA synthesis and the efficiency of utilization of messengers by ribosomes."

PRJNA198514,Transcription in Pronuclei and One- to Four-Cell Embryos Drives Early Development in a Nematode,"A long-standing view of development is that transcription is silenced in the oocyte until early divisions in the embryo. The point at which major transcription is reactivated varies in different organisms, but is usually after the 2-cell stage. However, this model may not be universal. We used RNA-seq and exploited the protracted development of the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum, to provide a comprehensive time course of mRNA expression, degradation, and translation during early development. Surprisingly, we find that ~4,000 genes are transcribed prior to pronuclear fusion and in the 1-4 cell embryos. Intriguingly, we do not detect maternal contribution of many orthologs of maternal C. elegans mRNAs, but instead find these are newly transcribed in the A. suum zygote prior to pronuclear fusion. Ribosome profiling demonstrates that, in general, early embryonic mRNAs are not stored for subsequent translation, but are directly translated following their synthesis. The role of maternally contributed and zygotically transcribed genes differs between the nematodes A. suum and C. elegans despite the fact that the two nematodes appear to exhibit highly similar morphological patterns during early development. Our study indicates that major transcription can occur immediately after fertilization and prior to pronuclear fusion in metazoa, suggesting that newly transcribed genes appear to drive A. suum early development. Furthermore, the mechanisms used for controlling the timing of the expression of key conserved genes has been altered between the two nematodes, illustrating significant plasticity in the regulatory networks that play important roles in developmental outcomes in nematodes. Overall design: A total of 28 samples are used for this study. The RNAs for the library construction are derived from 0.5 – 1 ml of synchronized embryo stages corresponding to a minimum of 0.5 billion embryos derived from > 1,000 female worms. The RNAs for polysome analysis are from pooled fractions of polysome gradient. For each sample, the amount of RNA for all polysome fractions is equivalent to the total RNA from the sample. Thus, the data from polysome profiling and RNA transcriptomes are considered as biological replicates. The level of the RNAs between each neighboring stages during development are considered as the reference for each other. Different sequencing strategies were applied for multiple libraries."

PRJNA193543,Loss of a Conserved tRNA Anticodon Modification Perturbs Cellular Signaling,"Transfer RNA (tRNA) modifications enhance the efficiency, specificity and fidelity of translation in all organisms. The anticodon modification mcm5s2U34 is required for normal growth and stress resistance in yeast; mutants lacking this modification have numerous phenotypes. Mutations in the homologous human genes are linked to neurological disease. The yeast phenotypes can be ameliorated by overexpression of specific tRNAs, suggesting that the modifications are necessary for efficient translation of specific codons. We determined the in vivo ribosome distributions at single codon resolution in yeast strains lacking mcm5s2U. We found accumulations at AAA, CAA, and GAA codons, suggesting that translation is slow when these codons are in the ribosomal A site, but these changes appeared too small to affect protein output. Instead, we observed activation of the GCN4-mediated stress response by a non- canonical pathway. Thus, loss of mcm5s2U causes global effects on gene expression due to perturbation of cellular signaling. Overall design: WT yeast and mutants lacking anticodon tRNA modifications were grown in YPD, and subjected to ribosome footprint profiling (ribo-seq) and RNA-seq of poly-A selected RNA. Dataset contains biological replicates for WT, ?ncs6 and ?uba4. Technical replicates were also performed for all RNA-seq datasets (using a different poly-A selection method)."

PRJNA185392,Translating transcriptome of cancer cells in situ in mesenchymal-rich tumor microenvironment,"A mesenchymal rich stroma such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in breast tumors favors the selection of cancer clones with enhanced bone metastatic ability. To determine the cancer cell transcriptomic response to the mesenchymal stroma, we supplemented experimental mammary tumours with or without exogenous mesenchymal cells. We used bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a source of mesenchymal stroma, as MSCs have been shown to undergo CAF-like differentiation. We engineered the cancer cells to express an EGFP-tagged version of ribosomal protein L10a (EGFP-L10a). This allows the retrieval of cancer cell specific transcripts rapidly from whole tumor lysates by translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and direct profiling of cancer cell gene expression patterns when they are in situ. Overall design: EGFP-10a+ MDA-MB-231 cells were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad with or without 1:1 ratio of MSCs.

These factors promote the survival of disseminated cancer cells in the bone marrow. To assess the combined responses elicited by CXCL12 and IGF1, we examined the translating transcriptome of cancer cells in response to these two factors by Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP)-RNAseq. Overall design: MDA-MB-231 cells were engineered to express an EGFP-tagged version of ribosomal protein L10a. This allows the retrieval of polysome-associated mRNA by anti-GFP pull down (TRAP) and profiling the translating transcriptome by RNAseq. EGFP-L10a+ cancer cells were serum starved (0.2% serum) for 24 hours, and then treated with CXCL12 (30ng/mL) + IGF1 (10ng/mL) or CXCL12 (300ng/mL) + IGF1 (100ng/mL) for 6hrs.

Rapid attenuation of global protein synthesis under stress conditions has been largely ascribed to the inhibition of translation initiation. To monitor the co-translational response to proteotoxic stress especially during elongation stage, we performed ribosome profiling (deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) and investigated the roles of chaperone molecules in this process."
PRJNA178171,Global analysis of Upf1 in mESCs reveals expanded scope of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a conserved RNA surveillance pathway that is an important modulator of disease pathology and is required for embryonic development.  Despite significant research effort, the rules that govern NMD remain incompletely understood. Here we used a combined¬ approach, integrating RNA-Seq, ribosome footprinting, and CLIP-Seq analysis of the essential NMD factor Upf1, to provide a more complete picture of the role of NMD in modulating gene expression in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs).  We show that presence of an exon-exon junction =50 nucleotides (nt) downstream of a termination codon (dEJ) contributes to NMD independently of 3'' UTR length, but has stronger effects in genes with shorter 3'' UTRs.  We also map translated upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in mESCs and show that they are associated with NMD regulation, especially of genes encoding transcription factors, and we find that lowly translated mRNAs can escape NMD.  Finally, we identify over 200 direct binding targets of Upf1 and describe a pathway of Upf1-dependent gene regulation reliant on Upf1 binding to the 3'' UTR and independent of presence of a dEJ.   Together, these analyses characterize known and discover novel determinants of NMD and establish a broader role in mESC gene regulation for Upf1. Overall design: mRNA-Seq analysis of wildtype (2 samples), translationally inhibited (by cycloheximide treatment, 2 samples),  control-depleted (2 samples),  and Upf1-depleted (4 samples) mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs); CLIP-Seq analysis of Upf1 (5 samples, and 5 samples of IgG control CLIP-Seq); Ribosome footprint profiling of wildtype (1 sample), control-depleted (1 sample), and Upf1-depleted (1 sample) mESCs"
PRJNA177820,Genome-wide translational changes induced by the prion [PSI+],"Prions are infectious proteins that can adopt a structural conformation different from that of the normal protein. This change of conformation is then propagated among other molecules of the same protein. Prions are associated with neurodegenerative diseases in mammals, but are also found in fungi (in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina), in which they control heritable traits. They are widespread in wild yeast strains, suggesting a biologically important role. [PSI+] is one of the most widely studied yeast prions. It corresponds to an aggregated conformation of the translational release factor, eRF3, which suppresses nonsense codons. [PSI+] modifies cellular fitness, inducing various phenotypes, depending on the genetic background. However, the genes displaying [PSI+]-controlled expression remain largely unknown. We used the recently described ribosome profiling approach to identify genes displaying changes in expression in the presence of [PSI+]. This made it possible to determine the positions of all active ribosomes within the genome, in both [PSI+] and [PSI-] isogenic strains. Comparisons of the translatomes and transcriptomes of the two strains revealed that the primary effect of [PSI+] was to repress genes involved in the stress response. Thus, we provide the first description of the global translational effect of [PSI+] and a new genetic explanation of the phenotypic differences between [PSI-] and [PSI+] strains under stress conditions. Overall design: Comparisons of the translatomes and transcriptomes of the two strains. Comparisons of the translatomes of the two strains : a  [PSI+] strain (two replicates) and a [PSI+] overexpressing SUP35-Cter strain."
PRJNA177721,Decoding human cytomegalovirus using ribosome profiling,"The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome was sequenced 20 years ago. However, like other complex viruses, our understanding of its protein coding potential is far from complete. Here, we use ribosome profiling and transcript analysis to experimentally define the HCMV translation products and follow their temporal expression. We identified several hundred previously unidentified open reading frames and confirmed a fraction by mass spectrometry. We found that regulated use of alternative transcript start sites plays a broad role in enabling tight temporal control of HCMV protein expression and allowing multiple distinct polypeptides to be generated from a single genomic locus. Our results reveal an unanticipated complexity to the HCMV coding capacity and illustrate the role of regulated changes in transcript start sites in generating this complexity. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq from 3 time points (5hr, 24hr, 72hr) along HCMV infection. The supplementary file 'GSE41605_merlin_final_orfs.bed.gz' includes the 751 ORFs of HCMV that were identified in this study."
PRJNA176310,Ribosome profiling in muscle reveals the translation landscape of the giant protein titin,"Purpose: Ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq were used to map the location and abundance of translating ribosomes on mouse heart and skeletal muscle transcripts. Methods: Tissue was rapidly harvested and snap-frozen to minimize bias to the pool of translating ribosomes.  RNA was prepared from a single homogenate for each tissue so that starting RNA populations for both libraries were closely matched.  Homogenates were not clarified before RNase digestion to avoid loss of ribosomes associated with large molecular weight complexes, and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared after rRNA subtraction to avoid positional loss of 5’ reads.  Trimmed reads from 50 cycles of Illumina single-end sequencing were mapped onto a non-redundant set of 18,499 mouse protein-coding RefSeq transcripts from the nuclear genome. Results: Mapped sequence reads to myosin, actin and the giant protein titin together account for ~20% of the total mRNA-derived ribosome protected fragments (RPFs).  We observed large-scale uniformity in the distribution of RPFs on the >30,000 codon titin open reading frame, from which we inferred an in vivo ribosome elongation error rate of =10-5.  Ribosome footprints on Ttn mRNA also uncovered a novel 5’ UTR within a phylogenetically conserved intronic element that would produce ~2.35 mDa titin isoform that corresponds to the titin ''T2'' band frequently described as a proteolytic artifact.  Local translation efficiency across several >10 kb muscle mRNAs was also uniform, while their global translation efficiencies varied by ~20-fold suggesting initiation rate plays a major role in the translation efficiency of large mRNAs. Evidence for RPFs on 5’ UTRs was widespread with particular enrichment for ribosomes positioned at CUG codons. Comparison of global translation efficiency in cardiac and skeletal muscle revealed novel examples of tissue-specific translational control including synthesis of the myogenic factor Mef2c, and the titin-binding stress response protein Ankrd23. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of translation in an adult mammalian tissue generated by ribosome profiling technology. Current limitations to using ribosomal profiling in tissues include unknown perturbations to the dynamic state of translation despite rapidly harvested and snap-frozen samples. The uniform 5’ to 3’ coverage observed on individual large mRNAs and the ability to observe footprints on the extremely small phospholamban coding sequence, suggests that initiation and elongation were halted on similar time scales.  More detailed examination of the positional information within CDS region requires further understanding of the bias introduced during the library preparation steps for both RPF-and RNA-Seq, as well as local biases induced as translation is arrested.   Despite these qualifications, this initial view of active translation in muscle tissue highlights the potential for ribosome profiling to monitor the dynamic translation response to exercise, injury or disease pathology in animal models at a level of resolution not easily attainable with other quantitative approaches. Overall design: Heart and skeletal muscle ribosome-protected fragment and RNA-Seq profiles of 10-week old C57BL/6J male mice were generated by deep sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2000."

Cross-species analyses showed that the zebrafish Myc model correlated well with Myc transgenic mouse models for liver cancers. The Myc-induced zebrafish liver tumors also possessed molecular signatures highly similar to human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, our zebrafish model demonstrated the conserved role of Myc in promoting hepatocarcinogenesis in all vertebrate species.

PRJNA173092,Regulatory impact of RNA secondary structure across the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome,"The secondary structure of an RNA molecule plays an integral role in its maturation, regulation, processing, and functionality. However, the global influence of this feature on plant gene expression is still for the most part unclear. Here, we use a high-throughput, sequencing-based, structure-mapping approach in conjunction with transcriptome-wide sequencing of polyA+-selected (RNA-seq), small (smRNA-seq), and ribosome-bound (ribo-seq) RNA populations to investigate the impact of RNA secondary structure on gene expression regulation in Arabidopsis. From this analysis, we find that highly unpaired and paired RNAs are strongly correlated with euchromatic and heterochromatic epigenetic histone modifications, respectively, providing further evidence that secondary structure is necessary for RNA-mediated posttranscriptional regulatory pathways. Additionally, we uncover key structural patterns across protein-coding transcripts that indicate RNA folding demarcates regions of protein translation and likely affects microRNA-mediated regulation of mRNAs in this model plant. We also reveal that RNA folding is significantly anti-correlated with overall transcript abundance, which is likely due to the increased propensity of highly structured mRNAs to be degraded and/or processed into smRNAs. Finally, we find that secondary structure affects mRNA translation, suggesting that this feature regulates plant gene expression at multiple levels. Overall, our findings provide the first global assessment of RNA folding and its significant regulatory effects in a plant transcriptome. Overall design: Single-stranded RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq) and ribosome-bound RNA sequencing (ribo-seq) in immature buds. A single replicate of each library."
PRJNA172014,Transcriptome-wide Regulation of Splicing and mRNA Localization by Muscleblind Proteins,"The Muscleblind-like (Mbnl) family of RNA-binding proteins plays important roles in muscle and eye development and in Myotonic Dystrophy (DM), where expanded CUG or CCUG repeats functionally deplete Mbnl proteins. We identified transcriptome-wide functional and biophysical targets of Mbnl proteins in brain, heart, muscle, and myoblasts using RNA sequencing and crosslinking/immunoprecipitation-sequencing approaches. This analysis identified several hundred splicing events whose regulation depended on Mbnl function, in a pattern indicative of functional interchangeability between Mbnl1 and Mbnl2. A nucleotide resolution RNA map associated repression or activation of exon splicing with Mbnl binding near either 3' splice site or near the downstream 5' splice site, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis of sub-cellular compartments uncovered a global role for Mbnls in regulating localization of mRNAs encoding membrane, synaptic and other proteins in both mouse and Drosophila cells, and Mbnls also contribute to protein secretion. These findings hold several new implications for DM pathogenesis. Overall design: To assess global functions of Muscleblind proteins, RNA-Seq was performed using WT and Mbnl1 KO brain, heart, and muscle (5 mice each). Additionally, C2C12 mouse myoblasts were depleted of Mbnl1, Mbnl2, or both. Subcellular fractionation experiments were performed to analyze mRNA localization following depletion of Mbnl1 and Mbnl2 in C2C12 mouse myoblasts, and following depletion of Mbnl in Drosophila S-2R+ cells. CLIP-Seq was also performed against Mbnl1 in mouse brain, heart, muscle, and C2C12 myoblasts. Finally, ribosome footprinting was performed with C2C12 mouse myoblasts that were depleted of Mbnl1, Mbnl2, or both."

PRJNA171135,Genome-wide search for novel human uORFs and N-terminal protein extensions using ribosomal footprinting,"So far, the annotation of translation initiation sites (TISs) has been based mostly upon bioinformatics rather than experimental evidence. We adapted ribosomal footprinting to puromycin-treated cells to generate a transcriptome-wide map of TISs in a human monocytic cell line. A neural network was trained on the ribosomal footprints at previously annotated AUG translation initiation codons (TICs), and used for the ab initio prediction of TISs in 5062 transcripts with sufficient sequence coverage. Functional interpretation suggested 2994 novel upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5´ UTR (924 AUG, 2070 near-cognate codons), 1406 uORFs overlapping with the coding sequence (116 AUG, 1290 near-cognate) and 546 N-terminal protein extensions (6 AUG, 540 near-cognate). The TIS detection method was validated on the basis of previously published alternative TISs and uORFs. On average, TICs in newly annotated TISs were significantly more conserved among primates than control codons, both for AUGs (p<10-10) and near-cognate codons (p=3.8×10-3). The derived transcriptome-wide map of novel candidate TISs will help to explain how human proteome diversity is influenced by alternative translation initiation and regulation.

We present a protocol for genome-wide, quantitative analysis of in vivo translation by deep sequencing. This ribosome profiling approach maps the exact positions of ribosomes on transcripts by nuclease footprinting. The nuclease-protected mRNA fragments are converted into a DNA library suitable for deep sequencing using a strategy that minimizes bias. The abundance of different footprint fragments in deep sequencing data reports on the amount of translation of a gene. Additionally, footprints reveal the exact regions of the transcriptome that are translated. To better define translated reading frames, we describe an adaptation that reveals the sites of translation initiation by pre-treating cells with harringtonine to immobilize initiating ribosomes. The protocol we describe requires 5 - 7 days to generate a completed ribosome profiling sequencing library.

PRJNA158351,Transcriptome-wide identification of LIN28A targets in mouse embryonic stem cell (A3-1) [Illumina Seq],"LIN28A is a highly-conserved RNA-binding protein which is known to be involved in embryonic development, stem cell maintenance and proliferation. LIN28A is expressed in various types of cancer, and they are associated with advanced tumor malignancy. In embryonic stem cell, LIN28A specifically binds to let-7 precursors to suppress biogenesis of the let-7 microRNA family. In addition, Lin28 was reported to bind several mRNAs such as Oct4, cyclin A/B and histone H2A to activate their translation. For comprehensive understanding of the interaction between LIN28A and their target RNAs, we exploited UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) to capture their in vivo binding to target RNAs. LIN28A-binding RNAs were identified in a mouse embryonic stem cell line using multiple monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. The result shows that LIN28A preferentially binds to let-7 precursors through GGAG binding motif, which is consistent with our previous results. We also identified that LIN28A binding is enriched in a certain subset of mRNAs. To understand the function of the novel LIN28A-mRNA binding, we carried out ribosome profiling from LIN28A-depleted mouse embryonic stem cells.

PRJNA152495,The anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence drives translational pausing and codon choice in bacteria,"Protein synthesis by ribosomes takes place on a linear substrate but at variable speeds. Transient pausing of ribosomes can impact a variety of co-translational processes, including protein targeting and folding. These pauses are influenced by the sequence of the mRNA. Thus redundancy in the genetic code allows the same protein to be translated at different rates. However, our knowledge of both the position and the mechanism of translational pausing in vivo is highly limited. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of translational pausing in bacteria using ribosome profiling-deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. This approach enables high-resolution measurement of ribosome density profiles along most transcripts at unperturbed, endogenous expression levels. Unexpectedly, we found that codons decoded by rare tRNAs do not lead to slow translation under nutrient-rich conditions. Instead, Shine-Dalgarno-(SD) like features within coding sequences cause pervasive translational pausing. Using an orthogonal ribosome possessing an altered anti-SD sequence, we demonstrated that pausing is due to hybridization between mRNA and the 16S rRNA of the translating ribosome. In protein coding sequences, internal SD sequences are disfavoured, which leads to biased usage, avoiding codons and codon pairs that resemble canonical SD sites. Our results indicate that internal SD-like sequences are a major determinant of translation rates and a global driving force for the coding of bacterial genomes.

However, the downstream translationally regulated nodes of gene expression that may direct cancer development are poorly characterized. Employing ribosome profiling we uncover specialized translation of the prostate cancer genome by oncogenic mTOR signaling, revealing a remarkably specific repertoire of genes involved in cell proliferation, metabolism, and invasion. We extend these findings by functionally characterizing a class of translationally controlled pro-invasion mRNAs that we show direct prostate cancer invasion and metastasis downstream of oncogenic mTOR signaling. We further develop a clinically relevant ATP site inhibitor of mTOR, INK128, which reprograms this gene expression signature with therapeutic benefit for prostate cancer metastasis, for which there is presently no cure. Together, these findings significantly extend our understanding of how the “cancerous” translation machinery steers specific cancer cell behaviors and may be therapeutically targeted.

These were used to validate the expression of short peptides idenitified by Mass-Spectrometry in K562 cells. Overall design: K562 polyA+ RNA (Batch 1) and total RNA (batch 2) was purchased from Ambion. We used oligo (dT)-selected polyA+ RNA to construct libraries for RNA-Seq.We then profiled the transcriptome of polyadenylated mRNA-Seq using Illumina sequencing platforms. We then used the sequenced reads to reconstruct the transcriptome using the Cufflinks de-novo assembler (Trapnell et al. Nat.Bio.Tech. 2010). Recent computational and ribosome profiling analyses suggest that many short open reading frames (sORFs) in eukaryotic genomes are translated. However, evidence that these sORFs produce stable polypeptides is lacking. Here we develop a strategy to discover and validate novel sORF-encoded polypeptides (SEPs) in human cells. In total, we detect 117 SEPs, 114 of which are novel, varying in length from 15 to 149 amino acids. Of these, 10 SEPs (0.5%) are derived from long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). We also observe the presence of polycistronic genes and the widespread use of non-AUG start codons, which is a phenomenon historically thought to be rare in the mammalian genome. Quantitative measurements reveal that SEPs can be found at concentrations between ~10-2000 copies per cell, which is within the range of typical cellular proteins. We confirm the translation of a number of these SEPs through heterologous expression of their encoding cDNAs. We also discover that several SEPs possess properties characteristic of functional proteins. These results demonstrate that human sORFs produce numerous stable polypeptides, revealing that the human proteome is larger and more diverse than previously appreciated."
PRJNA150397,Ribosome profiling of early zebrafish embryos -- miRNA-mediated regulation during embryogenesis causes translational repression before mRNA decay,"MicroRNAs regulate gene expression through deadenylation, repression and mRNA decay. However, the contribution of each mechanism in non-steady-state situations remains unclear.  We monitored the impact of miR-430 on ribosome occupancy of endogenous mRNAs in wild type and dicer mutants lacking mature miR-430. Our results indicate that miR-430 reduces the number of ribosomes on target mRNAs before causing mRNA decay. Translational repression occurs before complete deadenylation, and disrupting deadenylation using an internal poly(A) tail did not block target repression. Finally, we observe that ribosome density along the length of the target mRNA remains constant, suggesting that translational repression occurs by reducing the initiation rate rather than reducing elongation or causing ribosomal drop-off.

PRJNA149975,High-resolution view of the yeast meiotic program revealed by ribosome profiling,"Meiosis is a complex developmental process that generates haploid cells from diploid progenitors. We measured mRNA abundance and protein production through yeast sporulation and found strong temporal control for most genes, achieved through both mRNA levels and translational regulation. Monitoring the timing of protein production revealed novel factors involved in recombination and helped to illuminate the molecular basis of the broad restructuring of meiotic cells. We also found a strong increase in noncanonical translation at short open reading frames (sORFs) on unannnotated transcripts and upstream regions of known transcripts (uORFs). Ribosome occupancy at near-cognate uORFs was associated with more efficient ORF translation; while some AUG uORFs, often on regulated leader extensions, acted comptetitively. This work reveals a pervasive role for meiotic translational control and great complexity in genomic coding. Overall design: Fine mapping of gene expression through meiosis reveals extensive regulation of protein synthesis and widespread non-canonical translation."
PRJNA148631,Selective ribosome profiling reveals the co-translational chaperone action of trigger factor in vivo,"As nascent polypeptides exit ribosomes, they are engaged by a series of processing, targeting and folding factors. Here we present a selective ribosome profiling strategy that enables global monitoring of when these factors engage polypeptides in the complex cellular environment. Studies of the Escherichia coli chaperone Trigger Factor (TF) reveal that, while TF can interact with many polypeptides, ß-barrel outer membrane proteins are the most prominent substrates. Loss of TF leads to broad outer membrane defects and premature, cotranslational protein translocation. While in vitro studies suggested that TF is prebound to ribosomes waiting for polypeptides to emerge from the exit channel, we find that in vivo TF engages ribosomes only after ~100 amino acids are translated. Moreover, excess TF interferes with cotranslational removal of the N-terminal formyl methionine. Our studies support a triaging model in which proper protein biogenesis relies on the fine-tuned, sequential engagement of processing, targeting ad folding factors. Overall design: Examination of translation in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, as well as an analysis of the interactions between nascent chains and the molecular chaperone Trigger Factor."

PRJNA145711,Ribosome footprinting in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum,"In eukaryotic cells, the spatial regulation of protein expression is frequently conferred through the coupling of mRNA localization and the local control of translation. mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a prominent example of such regulation and serves a ubiquitous role in segregating the synthesis of secretory and integral membrane proteins to the ER. Recent genomic and biochemical studies have now expanded this view to suggest a role for the ER in global protein synthesis. We have utilized cell fractionation and ribosome profiling to obtain a genomic survey of the subcellular organization of mRNA translation and report that ribosomal loading of mRNAs, a proxy for mRNA translation, is biased to the ER. Notably, ER-associated mRNAs encoding both cytosolic and topogenic signal-encoding proteins display similar ribosome loading densities, suggesting that ER-associated ribosomes serve a global role in mRNA translation. We propose that the partitioning of mRNAs and their translation between the cytosol and ER compartments may represent a novel mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Overall design: HEK293 cells were fractionated between the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum. Within each fraction, ribosome footprints were generated and sequenced. In parallel, total mRNA was sequenced."

PRJNA144149,Ribosome Profiling of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Reveals the Complexity of Mammalian Proteomes,"The ability to sequence genomes has far outstripped approaches for deciphering the  information they encode. Here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome profiling (the deep-sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments), to provide genome-wide maps of protein  synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining rates of translation elongation. We exploit  the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation  together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis of  translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and novel  translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open  reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose  translation changes after differentiation. We also define a new class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding RNAs (sprcRNAs) that encode small proteins. Our studies reveal an unanticipated  complexity to mammalian proteomes. Overall design: Examination of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells and during differentiation into embryoid bodies"
PRJNA142553,Initiation Pausing of 80S Ribosome on mRNA Is Governed by 5’UTR and Responsive to mTORC1 Signaling (Microarray),""
PRJNA142427,Initiation Pausing of 80S Ribosome on mRNA Is Governed by 5'UTR and Responsive to mTORC1 Signaling (RNA-Seq),"Recent studies have revealed that the mRNA translation is punctuated by ribosomal pauses through the body of transcripts.  However, little is known about its physiological significance and regulatory aspects.  Here we present a multi-dimensional ribosome profiling approach to quantify the dynamics of initiation and elongation of 80S ribosomes across the entire transcriptome in mammalian cells.  We show that a subset of transcripts have a significant pausing of 80S ribosome around the start codon, creating a major barrier to the commitment of translation elongation.  Intriguingly, genes encoding ribosome proteins themselves exhibit an exceptionally high initiation pausing on their transcripts.  Our studies also reveal that the initiation pausing is dependent on the 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR) of mRNAs and subject to the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).  Thus, the initiation pausing of 80S ribosome represents a novel regulatory step in translational control mediated by nutrient signaling pathway. Overall design: Monitor the translational status of transcriptome in mammalian cells under different conditions"

Here we present a ribosome profiling strategy, based on deep sequencing of ribosome protected mRNA fragments, that enables genome-wide investigation of translation with sub-codon resolution. We used this technique to monitor translation in budding yeast under both rich and starvation conditions. These studies defined the protein sequences being translated and found extensive translational control both for determining absolute protein abundance and for responding to environmental stress. We also observed distinct phases during translation involving a large decrease in ribosome density going from early to late peptide elongation as well as wide-spread, regulated initiation at non-AUG codons. Ribosome profiling is readily adaptable to other organisms, making high-precision investigation of protein translation experimentally accessible.
