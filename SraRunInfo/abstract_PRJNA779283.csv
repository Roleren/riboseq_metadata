abstract
"To see a possible effect of a physiological warm temperature shift (WTS, 35°C to 38.5°C) on Per2 transcription and translation in mammalian cells, we performed RNA-seq and Ribo-seq using dexamethasone-synchronized mouse embryonic fibroblast cells with or without WTS treatment at a circadain rising phase of Per2. Overall design: We used Dex-synchronized MEF cells treated with or without 2-h WTS. WTS was applied 24 h after Dex synchronization (i.e., circadian rising phase of Per2). Three independent experiments were performed."
