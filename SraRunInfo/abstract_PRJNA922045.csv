abstract
"We used piRNA-deficient Maelstrom (Mael) knockout mice to investigate the effect of LINE-1 retrotransposon upregulation on translation efficiency (TE) in the germline. We collected Mael+/- and Mael-/- testes at postnatal day 16 (P16), when LINE-1 upregulation in Mael-/- spermatocytes is manifest, and performed ribosome profiling. RNA-seq analysis of the same samples was performed in parallel to evaluate the contribution of transcriptional changes to variations in footprint levels. Overall design: Comparative ribosome profiling analysis of P16 Mael-/- testes and their Mael+/- controls. Three biological replicates per genotype are reported."
