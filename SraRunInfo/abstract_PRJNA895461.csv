abstract
"Degradation of most yeast mRNAs involves decapping by Dcp1/Dcp2. DEAD-box protein Dhh1 has been implicated as an activator of decapping, and as a translational repressor, but their functions in cells are incompletely understood. We have analyzed these questions by a combination of ribosome profiling, RNA-Seq, CAGE analysis of capped mRNAs. Overall design: This study includes total 24 samples, 6 for ribosome profiling and 6 for RNA-Seq derived from duplicates of WT, dcp2D and dcp2-EE. Separately, total RNA of WT, dcp2, and xrn1 in duplicates,  were subjected to CAGE-Seq (6 samples) and total RNA-Seq (6 samples). All strains were grown in YPD at 30ÂºC till the OD600 ~0.6"
