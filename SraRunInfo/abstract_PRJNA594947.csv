abstract
"RNG140 is an RNA binding protein involved in the regulation of various cell differentiation and functional processes. Although RNG140 has been shown to inhibit translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, it is not known what kind of mRNAs were regulated their translation by RNG140. Comprehensive ribosome profiling revealed that overexpression of RNG140 in cultured CHO cells reduces translation of long mRNAs, including those associated with cell proliferation. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq in RNG140-GFP-expressing CHO cells and control CHO cells"
