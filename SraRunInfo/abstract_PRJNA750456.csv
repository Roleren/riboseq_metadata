abstract
"In eukaryotic cells, many mRNAs possess upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in addition to the main coding region. After uORF translation, the ribosome could either recycle at the stop codon or resume scanning for downstream start codons in a process known as reinitiation. Accumulating evidence suggests that some initiation factors, including eIF3, linger on the early elongating ribosome, forming an eIF3-80S complex. Very little is known how the eIF3 is carried along with the 80S during elongation and its implications in subsequent translation reinitiation. Here we report that eIF3a undergoes dynamic O-GlcNAc modification in response to nutrient starvation. Stress-induced de-O-GlcNAcylation promotes eIF3 retention on the elongating ribosome and facilitates reinitiation at downstream start codons. Eliminating the modification site from eIF3a via genome editing induces ATF4 reinitiation under the nutrient rich condition. Our findings illustrate a mechanism in balancing ribosome recycling and reinitiation, thereby linking integrated stress response and translational reprogramming. Overall design: Ribo-seq and eIF3-seq of WT and OTG knockout MEF cells with or without starvation, and with or without ThiametG treatment."
