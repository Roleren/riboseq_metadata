abstract
"A study of translation initiation and elongation in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line using ribosome footprint profiling (Ribo-seq). For this work, Ribo-seq was conducted with three different translation inhibitors along with RNA-seq to improve the characterisation of proteoforms and understand the impact of sub-physiological temperature on the CHO cell biological system."
