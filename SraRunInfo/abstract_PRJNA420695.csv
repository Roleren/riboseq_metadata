abstract
"To investigate whether natural TAG can be decoded by stably transfected pyltRNA, whole cell lysate of transgenic cells was collected 48h after the addition of NAEK and subjected to ribosome profiling, examining the physical locations of ribosomes along 15662 TAG terminated transcripts. And HEK293T cells were taken as control. Overall design: Examine the physical locations of ribosomes along 15662 TAG terminated transcripts in both transgenic and HEK293T cells"
