abstract
"Whole genome sequencing was performed to map causative mutations from an EMS screen for Nonstop mRNA Decay factors. RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, 3'RACE, and 5'RACE were performed to study the role of NONU-1 in Nonstop and No-Go mRNA Decay in C. elegans. NONU-1 results were compared to that of wild type and a known factor required for Nonstop/No-Go, SKIH-2."
