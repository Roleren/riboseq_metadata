"We performed Ribosome-protected mRNA fragment sequencing (Ribo-Seq) to determine if retinal circular RNAs are undergoing translation Overall design: Lysates from rat retinal tissues were prepared using lysis buffer with or without detergent. Lysates were digested with RNase I, purified and further processed for isolation of ribosome-protected RNA fragments. The recovered RNA fragments were subjected to ribosomal RNA removal using Illumina Ribo-Zero Gold kit and the samples were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500."
