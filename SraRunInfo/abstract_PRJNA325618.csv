"SOX2 signalling is required SCC initiation and maintenance. Ribosome profiling was used to describe the translational landscape of WT and SOX2 overexpressing P4 epidermis. Overall design: Mouse P4 WT and SOX2 epidermis was isolated for ribosome profiling and RNAseq. Furthermore, cultured WT, SOX2 and HRASG12V; TGFBR-2 KO keratinocytes were used for ribosome profiling."
