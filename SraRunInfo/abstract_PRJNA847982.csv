abstract
"In order to determine whether increased m6A abundance coupled with upregulation of transcripts regulating UPR also promote their translation, we first compared levels of key UPR signalling proteins in VIRMA FL-overexpressing SKBR3 cells and eGFP control. To our surprise, none of the key UPR signalling proteins measured showed increased levels in VIRMA FL cells compared to control We then performed ribosome profiling analysis between SKBR cells overexpressing VIRMA FL and eGFP control Overall design: Comparative translation analysis of Poly-ribo-seq data for VIRMA-overexpressing SKBR3 cells and eGFP control"
