abstract
"We performed rigorous ribosome profiling in FMCD mouse models with human MTOR point mutations. By obtaining about 10 million bases of sequence from FACS sorted mutation carrying cells in FMCD, we generated genome-wide translatome and transcriptome data of cortical neuron of FMCD. Overall design: Examination of transcriptome and translatome in 3 mouse types."
