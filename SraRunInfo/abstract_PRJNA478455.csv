"The goal of this project is to develop a high throughput proteomics approach to directly measure and quantify protein synthesis. Here, HeLa cells were stimulated with EGF, and ribosome profiling and mRNA sequencing was performed at various time points following stimulation to quantify changes in transcript abundance and translation. These data are compared to proteomics data to support the accuracy of the method as well as to gain insights into features captured in the proteomics data that may not be observed through traditional sequencing methods."
