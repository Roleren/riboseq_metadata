"Ribosome biogenesis is a complex and intricate process involving multiple factors. A plethora of auxiliary proteins assist the correct assembly of rRNA and ribosomal proteins into mature ribosomes. Defects in this process cause dysfunctional ribosomes which may alter protein synthesis and impair cell fitness. Despite its importance, yet we are lacking mechanistic details of ribosome biogenesis. Here we show that the widely-conserved RNA chaperone Hfq, which is an important post-transcriptional regulator in sRNA-mRNA basepairing in Escherichia coli, plays a critical role in rRNA processing and consequently ribosome assembly. Hfq binds the 17S rRNA precursor and facilitates its correct processing and folding to mature 16S rRNA. Strikingly, Hfq depletion decreases the pool of mature 70S ribosomes. Mutations in residues located in the distal face of Hfq render reduced ribosome levels in contrast to mutations in the proximal and rim surfaces which govern interactions with the sRNAs. Our results indicate that the described Hfq-dependent regulation of ribosomes is independent of its function as sRNA-regulator. Furthermore, we observed that inactivation of Hfq compromises translation efficiency and fidelity, both features of aberrantly assembled ribosomes. Our work expands the functions of Hfq beyond its function in small RNA-mediated regulation and unveil a novel role of Hfq as crucial auxiliary factor in ribosome biogenesis and translation.
