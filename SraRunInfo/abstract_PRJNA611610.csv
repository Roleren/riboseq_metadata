abstract
"The polyglutamine expansion of huntingtin (mHtt) causes Huntington disease (HD) and neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that mHtt promotes ribosome stalling and suppresses protein synthesis. Depletion of mHtt enhances protein synthesis and increases the speed of ribosome translocation, while mHtt directly inhibits protein synthesis in vitro. We found interactions of ribosomal proteins and translating ribosomes with mHtt. High-resolution global ribosome footprint profiling (Ribo-Seq) and mRNA-Seq indicated a widespread shift in ribosome occupancy toward the 5' and 3' end and unique single-codon pauses on selected mRNA targets in HD cells, compared to controls. Thus, mHtt impedes ribosomal translocation during translation by promoting ribosome stalling, a novel mechanistic defect that can be exploited for HD therapeutics. Overall design: RNA-seq: Control, HD-heterozygous, and HD-homozygous striatal cell line."
