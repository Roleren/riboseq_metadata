abstract
"Cellular senescence constitutes a generally irreversible proliferation barrier, accompanied by macromolecular damage and metabolic rewiring. Several senescence types have been identified based on the initiating stimulus, such as replicative (RS), stress-induced (SIS) and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Reduced protein synthesis is considered a senescence hallmark, but whether this trait pertains to various senescence subtypes and if distinct molecular mechanisms are involved remain largely unknown. Here, we analyze large published or experimentally produced RNA-seq and Ribo-seq datasets to determine whether major translation-regulating entities such as ribosome stalling, the presence of uORFs/dORFs and IRES elements may differentially contribute to translation deficiency in senescence subsets. We show that translation-regulating mechanisms may not be directly relevant to RS, however uORFs are significantly enriched in SIS. Interestingly, ribosome stalling, uORF/dORF patterns and IRES elements comprise predominant mechanisms upon OIS, strongly correlating with Notch pathway activation. Our study provides for the first time evidence that major translation dysregulation mechanisms/patterns occur during cellular senescence, but at different rates depending on the stimulus type. The degree at which those mechanisms accumulate directly correlates with translation deficiency levels. Our thorough analysis contributes to elucidating crucial and so far unknown differences in the translation machinery and ribosome biogenesis between senescence subsets. Overall design: Translation efficiency changes upon different senescent stimuli versus normal proliferating conditions in IMR 90 cell line"
