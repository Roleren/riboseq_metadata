"Ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) is a high-throughput sequencing technique for globally mapping the positions of translating ribosomes on the transcriptome. We infected Caco2 cells with human astrovirus 1 (HAstV1). Cells were harvested at 12 hpi and either flash frozen with no pre-treatment (NT), or pre-treated with lactimidomycin for 30 minutes followed by flash freezing (LTM). These samples where then used for ribosome profiling."
