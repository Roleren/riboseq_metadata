"To impose the heat treatment similar to the Structure-seq experiment, we applied Ribo-seq to 14-day-old rice (Oryza sativa) shoot tissue to investigate the effect of heat stress (42째C) as compared to control condition (22째C). Overall design: Two-week-old rice plants in pots were inverted and the shoots were immersed in a water bath at 22째C or 42째C for 10 min treatment, and ten shoots were harvested for each individual sample. Two biological replicates were obtained for each treatment and time-point. Ribosome profiling libraries were then made using these four sets of materials to determine the translational efficiency changes under different temperatures."
