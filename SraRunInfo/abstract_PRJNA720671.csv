abstract
"The C.elegans translatomes of single-nt let-7a 3' non-seed mutants (U13A / U18A). In order to identified gene perturbance caused by disrupting 3' non-seed pairing of let-7a, we examined the global gene expression at tranlational levels of L4 whole animals by ribosome profiling. We found that let-7a U13A mutation results in overexpression135/351 Note for let-7a U13A mutation, lin-41(ma480) was used in the background to filter out downstream regulation related to the lin-41 pathway. Overall design: Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) of L4 larvae of DG3913[lin-41(tn1541)], VT3878[lin-41(tn1541ma480);let-7(ma432)], VT1367(maIs105), VT3797[ma105,let-7(ma435)] at 20 Â°C."
