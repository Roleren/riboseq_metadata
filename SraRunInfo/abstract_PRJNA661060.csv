"We perform Selective Ribosome Profiling (SeRP) analysis of mouse Neuro2a neuronal cultures with Ebp1-immuno-precipitation in biological duplicate to assess the translation-specific function of Ebp1 Overall design: Each biological replicate analyzed for ribosome-protected mRNA fragments after RNAse digestion in both Ebp-ribosome immuno-precipitation conditions, and the total input ribosome pool, followed by by high-throughput sequencing."
