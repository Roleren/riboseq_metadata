"Goal of the study is to decipher the role of UPF1 in maintaining  transcriptome and translatome homeostasis in Arabidopsis Overall design: Leaf from three week old soil grown plants were used to perform ribosome depleted strand specific libraries (Illumina) from RNA isolated from monosomal, polysomal and total RNA. High throughput sequencing libraries were prepared from three biological replicate from pad4(Control) and upf1-3 pad4 mutant plants"
