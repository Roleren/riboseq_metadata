abstract
"In general, RNA-binding proteins act to modulate gene expression at transcript level through degradation or at protein level through translation.  To elucidate the effect of Whi3, a yeast RNA binding protein, on gene expression, we performed ribosome profiling experiment on whi3 mutant and wildtype cells. Overall design: Comparison ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data between whi3 mutant and wildtype cells"
