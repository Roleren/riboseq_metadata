"Silencing of FMR1 and loss of its gene product FMRP results in Fragile X Syndrome. FMRP binds brain mRNAs and inhibits polypeptide elongation. Using ribosome profiling of the hippocampus, we find that ribosome footprint levels in Fmr1-deficient tissue mostly reflect changes in RNA abundance. Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in wildtype tissue reveals a wide range of ribosome translocation rates; on many mRNAs, the ribosomes are stalled. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of hippocampal slices after ribosome runoff reveals that FMRP co-sediments with stalled ribosomes; and its loss results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs. One such mRNA encodes SETD2, a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K36me3. ChIP-Seq demonstrates that loss of FMRP alters the deployment of this epigenetic mark on chromatin. H3K36me3 is associated with alternative pre-RNA processing, which we find occurs in an FMRP-dependent manner on transcripts linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders. Overall design: H3K36me3 ChIP-seq was performed for hippocampus tissue from P35 C57BL/6N wild-type or Fmr1 KO male mice littermates. 4 animals (one hippocampi each) per genotype were used to generate 2 biological replicates per genotype (hippocampi from 2 animals was pooled per sample)"
