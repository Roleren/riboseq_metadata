abstract
"We report mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin's specific and genome-wide effect on mRNA translation. Using ribosome footprinting in pancreatic cancer cells that lack 4EBP1 expression we establish the effect of mTOR-S6-dependent mRNA translation, and identify translation programs activated following mTOR inhibition. Overall design: We performed ribosome footprinting and RNA sequencing on six samples of PANC1 cells: three control DMSO-treated biological replicates and three biological replicates collected 60 minutes after 50nM Rapamycin treatment. Control samples are labeled as 'CT', and Rapamycin-treated samples as 'RAPA'. Data from ribosome protected RNA are labeled as 'RF', and from total RNA as 'RNA'."
