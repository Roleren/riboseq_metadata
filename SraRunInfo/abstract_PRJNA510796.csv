abstract
"It is not fully known whether translational regulation also occurs in later stage immune responses, such as effector-triggered immunity (ETI), which often leads to strong metabolic dynamics. In this study, we performed a genome-wide ribosome profiling in Arabidopsis upon ETI activation and discovered that specific groups of genes were translationally regulated, especially metabolic genes in aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, camalexin, and sphingolipid metabolism. The involvement of these components in the induction of ETI was confirmed by genetic analysis, amino acid profiling and exogeneous application of phenylalanine or an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Our findings provide new insight into the diverse translational regulation in the plant immune responses and demonstrate that translational coordination of metabolic gene expression is an important strategy for ETI activation. Overall design: Arabidopsis transgenic lines carrying the 35S:uORFsTBF1-LUC construct in WT Col-0 (C) background or rps2 (R) background were grown on soil at 22 Â°C under a 12/12-h light/dark cycle with 55% humidity. Leaf tissue (0.3 g) of 4 week old transgenic plants was collected 8 hours post inoculation with either Psm ES4326/AvrRpt2 (OD600nm = 0.01) (A) or 10 mM MgCl2 as Mock (M). For WT plants, 3 replicates of Mock and AvrRpt2 were collected for RNA-seq (RS) and Ribo-seq (RF). For rps2, 2 replicates were collected for Mock and AvrRpt2 RS and RF."
