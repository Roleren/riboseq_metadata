abstract
"Ribosome profiling is a technique that permits genome-wide, quantitative analysis of translation and has found broad application in recent years. A key step is the depletion of ribosomal RNA that allows sufficient depth of sequencing of the mRNA undergoing ribosomal translation. These data are designed to compare four strategies for ribosomal depletion; a novel strategy based on duplex-specific nuclease using either one or two cycles, the antisense oligonucleotides described in Ingola et al (2012) and the commercially available RiboZero kit (with a no treatment control)."
