abstract
"The human WBSCR22 protein was identified as a methyltransferase for 18S rRNA m7G, which is involved in pre-rRNA processing and 40S ribosome subunit biogenesis. Recent studies have shown that WBSCR22 expression is upregulated in many cancers, however, the function of WBSCR22 in pancreatic cancer is still unknown. The goals of this part study are to compare transcriptome profiling of PANC-1-shWBSCR22 cells to control cells. By identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enrichment pathways, the mechanism of WBSCR22 in pancreatic cancer can be better studied. Overall design: mRNA profiles of PANC-1 cells transfected with shCtrl and shWBSCR22."
