abstract
"The translational efficiency of mRNAs of cells progressing synchronously through the mitotic cell cycle has been interrogated by ribosome profiling. Overall design: Ribosome Profiling (RP) and Transcriptional Profiling (TP) samples corresponding to a cell-size series, for the following Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome protein mutants: RPL22A, RPL22B, RPL34A, and RPL34B"
