abstract
"A large number of lncRNAs has been found aberrant expression in breast cancer and paly functional role in tumor progression. However, the role of small peptide hidden in lncRNA are largely unexplored.  In this study, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 screen and ribosome profiling to systematically discover nocanonical open reading frame encoded in long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and explored their critical roles in ER+ breast cancer. Overall design: CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen and ribosome profiling to systematically discover nocanonical open reading frame encoded in long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and explored their critical roles in ER-positive cancer progression."
