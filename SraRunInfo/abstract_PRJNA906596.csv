abstract
"The response to acidity is crucial for neutralophilic bacteria. Escherichia coli has a well characterized regulatory network to induce multiple defense mechanisms against excess of protons. Nevertheless, systemic studies of the transcriptional and translational reprogramming of E. coli to different acidic strengths have not yet been performed. Here, we used ribosome profiling and mRNA sequencing to determine the response of E. coli to pH 7.6, 5.8 and 4.4. Data were analyzed using the high-throughput HRIBO pipeline and previously undetected adaptations of E. coli to acid stress were found including up-regulation of glycerol catabolism and siderophore production, down-regulation of many membrane proteins and regulation by the transcriptional regulators YdeO, MhpR, IscR, and YdcI. Several examples of differential transcriptional and translational regulation of genes were identified as well as potential novel small open reading frames. These results expand the acid resistance network and provide new insights into the fine-tuned response of E. coli. Overall design: Comparison of genome-wide mRNA levels and translational activity at pH 7.6, 5.8 and 4.4 in LB medium."
