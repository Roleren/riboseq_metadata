abstract
"Phospho-ribosome associated RNAs were immunopurified using the antibodies against phospho-S6. The purified RNAs were converted to cDNAs, which were sequenced in Illumina HiSeq platform. Vomeronasal organs were extracted from male CD-1 animals exposed to either pup cues or fresh bedding. Overall design: Total of 6 samples, 2 conditions and 3 replicates"
