"An analysis of the structural, functional, and immunogenicity implications of F9 gene recoding. Codon optimized F9 constructs were compared for potential changes in protein folding, function, or immunogenicity. Among other techniques, ribosome profiling was used to analyze translation kinetics and possible impact of protein structure and function."
