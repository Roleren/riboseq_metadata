abstract
"In eukaryotic cells, most introns are degraded soon after splicing in the nucleus but some persist either due to lack of splicing (detained/retained introns) or because they contain important functional elements, for example, sno/scaRNAs. Few introns are detectable outside the nucleus. To hunt for interesting new phenomena in cytoplasmic introns and splicing, we conducted a multimodal study of total RNA within projections (axons, dendrites, glial projections) of rat hippocampal neurons and discovered a class of free circular introns enriched in distal projections. Overall design: A variety of sequencing datasets from rat primary hippocampal neurons are provided: From physically separated cellular projections and whole-cell lysates, (a) rRNA-depleted total RNA-seq (5 biological replicates, each) and (b) polyA site sequencing or PAS-seq (3 biological replicates, each); from fractionated cytoplasmic lysate (c) ribosome profiling (3 biological replicates) and (d) polyA+ RNA-seq (3 biological replicates)."
