abstract
"We treated HEK293T cells with different doses of RNase and sequence RNA fragements after the treatments. Furthermore, we developed a low-input RNase footprinting approach to quantify genome-wide RNA translation using 50,000 and 1,000 HEK293T and K562 cells. The ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data were used as the control. Overall design: 1. HEK293T cells were treated with 3 different doses of RNase (i.e. low, medium, high) and RNA fragments were isolated for sequencing. 2. Low-input RNase footprinting for 50,000 and 1,000 HEK293T and K562 cells. 3. Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data for HEK293T and K562 cells were used for comparisons."
