abstract
"Our study highlights the power of interpreting available “omics” datasets with a focus on small proteins, and may serve as a blueprint for a data integration-based survey of small proteins in diverse bacteria. Overall design: Ribosome profiling analysis of the Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344 translatome paired with transcriptome sequencing"
