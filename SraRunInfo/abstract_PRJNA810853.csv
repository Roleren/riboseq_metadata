abstract
"Exposure to certain stresses leads to readthrough transcription downstream of gene ends. Here we found that this phenomenon impacts the expression of genes located downstream to readthrough genes, whereby readthrough transcription proceeds into downstream genes, termed read-in genes. Using polyA-selected RNA-seq data from mouse fibroblasts, we identified widespread read-in in heat shock, oxidative and osmotic stress conditions. Read-in genes share distinctive genomic characteristics; they are extremely short, mainly due to less, shorter, introns, and they are highly GC rich. Furthermore, using ribosome footprint profiling we found that the translation of genes with high degrees of read-in is significantly reduced. Strikingly, read-in genes show extremely high levels of intron retention during stress, mostly in their first intron. While read-in genes share features that are generally associated with increased likelihood of intron retention, such as short introns and high GC content, intron retention in read-in genes during stress exceeds greatly beyond what is expected given their genomic properties. Finally, we found that first introns in read-in genes have weaker 5' and 3' splice sites. Our data portray a relationship between read-in and intron retention, suggesting it may have co-evolved to facilitate reduced translation of read-in genes during stress. Overall design: Induction of various types of stress in NIH3T3 cells, followed by transcriptome and translatome analysis."
