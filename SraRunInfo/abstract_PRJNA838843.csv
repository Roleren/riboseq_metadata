abstract
"Protein synthesis is strictly regulated during replicative aging in yeast, but global translational regulation during replicative aging is poorly characterized. To conduct ribosomal profiling during replicative aging, we collected a large number of dividing aged cells using a miniature chemostat aging device. Translational efficiency, defined as the number of ribosome footprints normalized to transcript abundance, was compared between young and aged cells for each gene. We identified more than 700 genes with changes greater than twofold during replicative aging. Increased translational efficiency was observed in genes involved in DNA repair and chromosome organization. Decreased translational efficiency was observed in genes encoding ribosome components, transposon Ty1 and Ty2 genes, transcription factor HAC1 genes associated with the unfolded protein response, genes involved in cell wall synthesis and assembly, and ammonium permease genes. Our results provide a global view of translational regulation during replicative aging, in which the pathways involved in various cell functions are translationally regulated and cause diverse phenotypic changes. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells in the replicative aging using the MAD system"
