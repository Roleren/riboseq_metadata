abstract
"To investigate AR regulated transcription, full length, AR-v19 splice variant or total AR was siRNA depleted or AR-V19 was overexpressed in UM-UC-3 cells. Overall design: Following ribosome depletion for transcript enrichment we then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of 6 conditions."
