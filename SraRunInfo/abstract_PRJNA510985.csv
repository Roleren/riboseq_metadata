abstract
"Hcr1/eIF3j is a sub-stoichiometric subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) that can dissociate the post-termination 40S ribosomal subunit from mRNA in vitro. We examined this ribosome recycling role in vivo by ribosome profiling and reporter assays and found that loss of Hcr1 led to reinitiation of translation in 3'UTRs, consistent with a defect in recycling. However, the defect appeared to be in recycling of the 60S subunit, rather than the 40S subunit, because reinitiation did not require an AUG codon and was suppressed by overexpression of the 60S dissociation factor Rli1/ABCE1. Consistent with a 60S recycling role, overexpression of Hcr1 could not compensate for loss of 40S recycling factors Tma64/eIF2D and Tma20/MCT-1. Intriguingly, loss of Hcr1 triggered higher expression of RLI1 via an apparent feedback loop. These findings suggest Hcr1/eIF3j is recruited to ribosomes at stop codons and may coordinate the transition to a new round of translation. Overall design: 25 biological samples are included in the study for ribosome footprinting and mRNA-Seq. These include wild-type and combination knockouts of Hcr1 and mutations of other eIF3 subunits and known ribosome recycling factors."
