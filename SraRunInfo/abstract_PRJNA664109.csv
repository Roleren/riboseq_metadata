"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4G2 is a long-known homologue of the canonical eIF4G1. However, unlike the latter, it does not bind eIF4E or PABP, thus it remains unclear what and when brings eIF4G2 onto a ribosome. Here we report results of  ribosome profiling performed in NIH 3T3 eIF4G2 (DAP5) -/- cells. Overall design: Sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments and total RNA in wild-type NIH 3T3 and eIF4G2(-/-) NIH 3T3 cells"
