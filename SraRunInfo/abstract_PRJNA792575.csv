abstract
"This dataset contains RNA sequencing results from  adult male prairie voles that were in either opposite-sex or same-sex pairs that were subsequently either separated from or remained paired with their partner for either 48 hours or 4 weeks prior to collecting nucleus accumbens tissue. The goal of this experiment was to determine the nucleus accumbens transcriptional response specific to separation from an opposite-sex partner. RNA sequencing was done on polyA enriched transcripts using Illumina single-end sequencing. Samples from 3 groups were from a Ribo-seq protocol using a virally delievered, vole optimized Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification construct (Heiman et al., 2008). These samples contain files for both the input fraction and the pulldown fraction (denoted with a _P suffix). Overall design: This experiment contains 8 groups with 5-9 biological samples per group. Samples were hand dissected adult male prairie vole nucleus accumbens brain tisame-sexue according to Heiman et al., 2014. Half of the groups were males in opposite-sex pairs (experimental groups) while the other half were males in same-sex pairs (naive, control groups). Within each pairing type, animals were cohoused for 2 weeks then they were either separated or remained paired for either 48 hours or 4 weeks prior to tissue collection to assess the transcriptional trajectory of partner loss. RNA integrity and library quality was assessed by TapeStation and only samples with a RIN above 7.3 were prepared into libraries. Library preparation was via the KAPA mRNA HyperPrep kit with polyA enrichment for 1X75 RNA sequencing using Illumina NextSeq V2 for a total read depth of ~20M reads/sample. Samples that were part of the vTRAP groups have both input and pulldown files."
