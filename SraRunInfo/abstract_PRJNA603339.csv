abstract
"RIBO-SEQ and mRNA-SEQ were conducted on HEK-293T cells stably expressing wild-type (WT, RefSeq NM_000133.3) or a single synonymous mutant (c.459G>A) version of the F9 gene. This particular mutant has been reported to cause mild hemophilia B. Three replicates of RIBO-SEQ and mRNA-SEQ are included for cells stably expressing each of the constructs."
