abstract
"To demonstrate this regulation at the nucleotide level, we developed the selective ribosome footprint (Select-Ribo-seq) of the FLUC mRNAs. Select-Ribo-seq used in vitro synthesized and biotin-labeled probes to enrich the ribosome-bound target gene fragments, which will be helpful in translatome profiling of low-abundance or cell-specific genes in complex tissue."
