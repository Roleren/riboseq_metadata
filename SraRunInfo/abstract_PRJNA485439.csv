"Translation is a fundamental biological process, which defines every aspect of cell physiology. Dysregulation of protein synthesis is associated with the diseases, such as ribosomopathies, diabetes, and cancer. To examine translation dysregulation in vivo, we employed RNA interference to knockdown m-subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF3 exclusively in mouse liver. We observed an increase in the number of monosomes and multiple signs of impaired translation. We further characterized the early cellular response using transcriptome sequencing, ribosome profiling, whole proteome, and phosphoproteome analyses. The major response of hepatocytes to eIF3m deficiency was associated with the changes in mRNA expression, with almost no effect on translation efficiency for particular mRNAs. The transcription changes fell into two main categories: ribosome biogenesis (increased transcription of ribosomal proteins, dephosphorylation of eIF2a, and inhibition of rRNA processing) and cell metabolism (lipid, amino acid, nucleic acid, and drug metabolism). Overall, this work uncovers a new mode of regulation of protein synthesis mediated by the inhibition of translation initiation. It also highlights advantages of RNAi-based in vivo approach for studying regulatory network associated with essential factors involved in mammalian translation. Overall design: RNAseq experiment comparing 3 replicates of Eif3m knockdown mouse livers with 3 replicates of control mouse livers at day 9 and 3 replicates of Eif3m knockdown mouse livers with 3 replicates of control mouse livers at day 13."
