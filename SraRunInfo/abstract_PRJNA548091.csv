"The ribosome is not only a protein-making machine, but also a regulatory element in protein synthesis. This view is supported by our earlier data showing that Arabidopsis mitoribosomes altered due to the silencing of the nuclear RPS10 gene encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein S10 differentially translate mitochondrial transcripts compared with the wild-type. Here, we used ribosome profiling to determine the contribution of transcriptional and translational control in the regulation of protein synthesis in rps10 mitochondria compared with the wild-type ones. Oxidative phosphorylation system proteins are preferentially synthesized in wild-type mitochondria but this feature is lost in the mutant. The rps10 mitoribosomes show slightly reduced translation efficiency of most respiration-related proteins and at the same time markedly more efficiently synthesize ribosomal proteins and MatR and TatC proteins. The mitoribosomes deficient in S10 protein protect shorter transcript fragments which exhibit a weaker 3-nucleotide periodicity compared with the wild-type. The decrease in the triplet periodicity is particularly drastic for genes containing introns. Notably, splicing is considerably less effective in the mutant, indicating an unexpected link between the deficiency of S10 and mitochondrial splicing. Thus, a shortage of the mitoribosomal S10 protein has wide-ranging consequences on mitochondrial gene expression. Overall design: Mitochondrial ribosome footprints from youngest leaves of 9-10 week-old wildtype or P2 and P3 phenotypes of heterozygous rps10 mutant"
