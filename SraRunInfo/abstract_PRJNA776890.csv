"Cashmere fineness is an important index to evaluate cashmere quality. Liaoning Cashmere Goat (LCG) has a large cashmere production and long cashmere fiber. But the fineness is not enough,improving the fineness of cashmere is an important problem.Therefore, it is important to find genes involved in cashmere fineness that can be used in future in future endeavors aiming to improve this phenotype. With the continuous advancement of research, the regulation of cashmere fineness has made new development through high-throughput sequencing and genome-wide association analysis. It has been found that translatomics can identify genes associated with phenotypic traits. Through a translatomic analysis, the skin tissue of LCG sample groups differing in cashmere fineness was sequenced by Ribo-seq. With this data, we identified 529 differentially expressed genes between the sample groups among the 27197 expressed genes(expressed,not co-expressed). From these, 343 genes were up-regulated in the fine LCG group in relation to the coarse LCG group and 186 down-regulated in the same relationship.Through GO enrichment analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential genes, the biological functions and pathways of differential genes can be found. In the GO enrichment analysis, 491 genes were significantly enriched, and the functional region was mainly in the extracellular region. In the KEGG enrichment analysis, the enrichment of human papillomavirus infection pathway was the most. We found that COL6A5 gene may affect cashmere fineness. The characteristics and expression analysis of COL6A5 gene may play an important role in the study of LCG cashmere fineness. Overall design: The genes affecting cashmere fineness were screened by translatomics in three coarse and three fine Liaoning cashmere goats."
