abstract
"The noncoding genome plays an important role in de novo gene birth and the emergence of genetic novelty. Nevertheless, how the properties of noncoding sequences could promote the birth of novel genes and shape the structural diversity and evolution of proteins remains unclear. Here, we investigated the potential of the noncoding genome of yeast to produce novel protein bricks that can give rise to novel genes or be integrated in pre-existing proteins, thus participating in protein structure evolution and diversity. Combining different bioinformatics approaches, we showed that intergenic ORFs of yeast encompass the large structural diversity of canonical proteins with the majority encoding peptides predicted as foldable. Then, we investigated the early stages of de novo gene birth with Ribosome Profiling and systematic reconstruction of yeast de novo gene ancestral sequences. We highlighted sequence and structural factors determining de novo gene birth and protein evolution. Finally, we showed a strong correlation between the fold potential of de novo genes and their ancestral ORFs reflecting the relationship between the noncoding genome and the protein structure universe. Overall design: RiboSeq of two replicates of the same BY 4742 yeast  strain, to identify for alternative CDS in unanotated regions, such CDS are then called IGORFs if RiboSeq signal is detected."
