abstract
"A forward genetic screen identified a mutation in the previously uncharacterized gene F01D4.5--homologous with human TCF20 and RAI1--that suppresses the adverse phenotypes observed in m-tyrosine-treated tyrosine aminotransferase mutant C. elegans. To gain insights into the function of F01D4.5. RNA was isolated from N2 and F01D4.5(baf20)  mutants and used for whole transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing. Analysis of the data reveals a signficant reduction in the expression of ribosome protein encoding genes suggesting a diminution in protein synthesis as a compensatory mechansims to abate the adverse effects of m-tyrosine Overall design: mRNA profiles of N2 and F01D4.5(baf20) C. elegans 48 hours post-L1 arrest generated by deep sequencing, five biological replicates per strain, using the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform"
