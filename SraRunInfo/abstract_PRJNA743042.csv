abstract
"In this study, we utilized a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I) carrying a homozygous nonsense mutation in the Idua gene (Idua-W401X, TGG?TAG) to develop rAAV-delivered sup-tRNA therapeutics that can overcome a pathogenic UAG premature termination codon (PTC). Overall design: Liver ribosome profilings in sup-tRNA treated and untreated homozygous Idua-W401X mice and patient fibroblasts."
