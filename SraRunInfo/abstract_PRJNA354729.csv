abstract
G2019S mutaion of LRRK2 is known to increase mRNA translation. We perform ribosome profiling to study defective translation using human dopamine neuron models. Patient-derived human dopamine neurons with G2019S LRRK2 mutation were generated and used. Also a mutation-corrected isogenic pair line was used. Overall design: hDA neurons: 60 days old samples were used.
