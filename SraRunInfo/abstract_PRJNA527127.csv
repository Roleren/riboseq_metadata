abstract
"Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were infected with wild-type simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) strain 17 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Ribosome profiling was performed at various times during infection with minor modification to the protocol described in Stern-Ginossar N et al., Science 2012. Translation start site profiling was performed by culturing cells in presence of Harringtonin or Lactimidomycin for 30 min prior to cell harvest. Overall design: Ribosome profiling was performed a 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post infection. Translation start site profiling was performed using Harringtonin (2µ/ml for for 30 min) or Lactimidomycin (50µM for 30 min) prior to cell lysis. Two biological replicates were analysed."
