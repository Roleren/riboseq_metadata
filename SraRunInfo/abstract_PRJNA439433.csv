abstract
"We used cell-type-specific ribosome profiling (Ribo-tag) to study the impacts of aging and oxidative stress on the expression of actively translated mRNA in adult Drosophila oenocytes. Polysome associated mRNAs from oenocyte were extracted from young flies and aged flies, treated with water or paraquat. Restults provide insight into aging mechanism and tissue specific response to stress in oenocyte. Overall design: Drosophila melanogaster expressing FLAG tagged Rpl13A under oneocyte driver (PromE-Gal4 > Rpl13A-FLAG) was used in the experiment. Samples were collected in three replicate from sexually-mature freely-mated adults. Young (1-2 weeks old) and aged (4 weeks old) adults were transferred on control food or paraquat (10mM) food for 24 hours prior to mRNA extraction. Polysome were pulled down using anti-FLAG antibody and total RNAs were extracted. PolyA+ RNA was obtained from the total RNAs and was prepared to RNA-seq libraries. We further multiplexed RNA-seq libraries with indexed adaptors and pooled for sequencing."
