"Ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) analysis of murine 17 clone 1 (17Cl-1) cells with and without Tunicamycin treatment. Tunicamycin is known to induce the unfolded protein response,  and the objective of this work was to assess the impact of Tunicamycin on cellular translation. Additionally, we sought to assess the impact of differing library preparation methods by using three separate approaches: flash freezing, 1X Cycloheximide, and 100X Cycloheximide."
