abstract
"Summary Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) serve a dual role in charging tRNAs. Their enzymatic activities both provide protein synthesis flux and reduce uncharged tRNA levels. Although uncharged tRNAs can negatively impact bacterial growth, substantial concentrations of tRNAs remain deacylated even under nutrient-rich conditions. Here we show that tRNA charging in Bacillus subtilis is not maximized due to optimization of aaRS production during rapid growth, which prioritizes demands in protein synthesis over charging levels. The presence of uncharged tRNAs is alleviated by precisely tuned translation kinetics and the stringent response, both insensitive to aaRS overproduction but sharply responsive to underproduction, allowing for just-enough aaRS production atop a “fitness cliff”. Notably, we find that the stringent response mitigates fitness defects at all aaRS underproduction levels even without external starvation. Thus, adherence to minimal, flux-satisfying protein production drives limited tRNA charging and provides a basis for the sensitivity and setpoints of an integrated growth-control network. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq experiments of Bacillus subtilis strains"
