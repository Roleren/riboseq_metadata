abstract
"Expression of selenoproteins requires the co-translational incorporation of selenocysteine (Sec) in response to an in-frame UGA codon. The machinery of UGA/Sec re-coding is complex and many factors affect the hierarchy of expression among selenoproteins, including modification of tRNA[Ser]Sec. Its hyper-modification in the anticodon stem loop is influenced by selenium bioavailability, and a mutation in adenosine 37 (A37) that abrogates isopentenylation, has a profound effect on selenoprotein expression in mice. Patients with mutations in tRNA-isopentenyl-transferase (TRIT1) show a severe neurological disorder and hence we wondered whether mutations in TRIT1 negatively affected the expression of selenoproteins. Fibroblasts from a patient carrying a pathogenic R323Q mutation in TRIT1 in homozygosity did not show decreased selenoprotein expression, although recombinant TRIT1R323Q had significantly reduced activity in vitro towards anticodon stem-loop substrates. We thus engineered mice conditionally deficient in Trit1 in hepatocytes and neurons. Selenoprotein expression as assessed by western blotting, 75Se metabolic labeling, and ribosomal profiling was not decreased despite the general reduction of N6-isopentenyl-adenosine in tRNAs. We show that 5-methylcarboxymethylation and 2'O-methylation of U34 occur independently of isopentenylation of A37 in tRNA[Ser]Sec. Reanalyzing previously published ribosomal profiling datasets, we demonstrate that (i) failure of 5-carboxymethylation at U34 is associated with reduced expression of GPX1, but not GPX4, and that (ii) FTSJ1 is not the elusive U34-2'O-methyltransferase involved in the methylation of tRNA[Ser]Sec. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of liver samples from 3 Trit1-deficient mice and 3 control mice"
