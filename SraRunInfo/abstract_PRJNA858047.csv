abstract
"THP-1 cells were treated with vehicle control (0.1% ethanol/PBS), LPS and LPS+Dex for 3 hr. We then performed combined analysis of ribosome footprints (RPF) and mRNA abundance using the data obtained by Ribo-Seq and RNA-seq in THP-1 cells. Overall design: Integrative analysis of Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq data from LPS and LPS+Dex treated THP-1 cells."
