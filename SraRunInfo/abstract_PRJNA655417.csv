abstract
"Here, we employed ribosome profiling to explore global changes in mRNA translational status in neuronally differentiated neuroblast cultures at several time-points after whole cell depolarisation, and compared this to steady-state mRNA levels. Immediately after depolarisation, genes with known function at the synapse were subjected to a surge of translational activity without corresponding changes in mRNA levels. At later time-points, however, these changes became synchronised, suggesting there are different layers of post-transcriptional regulation which are temporally separated but become coordinated over time. Sequencing of small RNAs additionally revealed that changes in microRNA (miRNA) and tRNA-derived small RNA fragments (tRFs) coincided with this early post-transcriptional disparity, however these molecules exhibited strongest association with the remodelling of mRNA steady-state levels. Transcripts displaying high levels of translational dynamics relative to underlying mRNA levels were characterised by more intrinsic features, including mRNA length, GC content, secondary structure and motifs for RNA binding proteins. These data suggest that activity-associated neuronal translation is initially regulated independently of mRNA levels, wherein transcript features contribute to modulation of mRNA translatability, while miRNA and tRFs fine-tune mRNA levels. Overall design: Examination of changes in mRNA translation, expression and small RNA expression in neuronally differentiated SH-SY5Y cells."
