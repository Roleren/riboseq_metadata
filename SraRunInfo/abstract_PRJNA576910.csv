abstract
"Transcriptional profiling of transitional and follicular B cells showed that metabolic quiescence was acquired at the follicular B cell stage in both humans and mice, characterized by an orchestrated reduction of mTORC1 signaling, aerobic respiration and expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. Overall design: RNAseq analysis of transitional and follicular B cells from healthy human donors and C57BL/6 (wild-type) mice"
