abstract
"Hfq is a transcriptional and translational pleiotropic regulator in several bacteria. RNA-Seq, Ribo-Seq and Proteomic analyses were carried out in the wild-type and a hfq deletion strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 with the intention to separate the influence of Hfq on the transcript stability and translation. This submission relates to the RNA-Seq data only. RNA was extracted from two replicate cultures each of SBW25-WT and SBW25-?hfq strains and, after removal of ribosomal RNA, subjected to RNA-Seq in an Illumina NextSeq500 machine. The resulting sequence data was analysed by mapping to the reference sequence of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 as available in the Genbank accession NC_012660."
