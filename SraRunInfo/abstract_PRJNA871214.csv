abstract
"We report that m6A reader IGF2BP2 participates in the regulation of glutamine metabolism in AML. To further clarify whether IGF2BP2 knockdown (KD) leads to translational inhibition, we perform Ribo-seq in control and IGF2BP2 KD cells. Overall design: MM6 cells infected with shNS or shIGF2BP2 (including shBP2B and shBP2D) were employed for ribo-seq."
