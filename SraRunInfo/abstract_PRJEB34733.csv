"Ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) is a high-throughput sequencing technique for globally mapping the positions of translating ribosomes on the transcriptome. We infected A549 cells with influenza A virus (PR8 strain). Cells were harvested at 5 hpi by flash freezing with no drug pre-treatment, and used for ribosome profiling."
