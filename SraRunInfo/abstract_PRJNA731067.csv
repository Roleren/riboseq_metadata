abstract
The next-generation-sequencing (NGS) of ribosome footprintings and poly(A) enriched RNA-seq have been proformed to examine transcriptional and translational changes in an mouse insulinoma cell MIN6 under acute and chronic endoplasmic reticular stresses. Overall design: Mouse insulinoma cell MIN6 treated with 200uM of Cyclopiazonic acid for 1 (CPA1) and 18 hours (CPA18). An 18 hour DMSO treatment served as the control (CPA0). Ribo-seq and poly(A) enriched RNA-seq (mRNA-seq) have been proformed. Three independent biological replications were proformed.
