abstract
"Information on the role of Fgdicer2-dependent miRNA on transcriptional and translational gene expression in plant pathogenic fungi is very limited. To further investigate the role of Fgdicer2 in miRNA biogenesis, and how the dicer2-dependent miRNAs regulate gene expression at transcriptional and translational level, we created a Fgdicer2 mutant and performed ribo-seq of Fgdicer2 and wildtype Fg grown in culture. This analysis revealed that there were no changes in the overall distribution of transcriptional gene expression in these genotypes . In contrast, the overall distribution of gene expression at both translational levels and TEs were increased in the Fgdicer2 mutant compared to wildtype Fg. This could be due to the loss of Fgdicer2-dependent miRNA-repression."
