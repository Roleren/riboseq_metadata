abstract
"Research on plant-pathogen interactions obtained from transcriptional level by next-generation sequencing technologies or microarray chips may not reflect the actual expression levels of the proteins that are the executors of biological processes in cells. Regulatory mechanisms during the post-transcriptional and translational phases may be more important in governing the protein expression levels in cells. Research has shown that full-length translating mRNA profiling, or ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound RNA sequencing (RNC-seq) better reflects protein expression and abundance. We used the the RNC-seq method in addition to the traditional mRNA-seq method to reveal post-transcriptional regulations of gene expression in a verticillium-susceptible Gossypium hirsutum TM-1 in response to V. dahliae inoculation."
