"We present a basic characterization of the function of Y-box binding proteins in C. elegans. Besides playing an important role for fertility in the germline (all four CEY proteins), we found that the presence of CEY-1 and CEY-4 is essential for the assembly of larger polysomes in the soma. We therefore performed ribosome-profiling in combination with total RNA sequencing in wild type and cey-1,-4 double mutant animals to globally compare mRNA levels and their translation status. Overall design: Total RNA sequencing was peformed on RNA extacted from wild type and cey-1,-4 mutant animals in duplicates. Four samples in total."
