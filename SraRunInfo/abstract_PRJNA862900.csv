abstract
"Prion-like domain (PrLD) is a class of intrinsically disordered regions. Although its propensity to form condensates has been studied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, the physiological role of PrLD remains unclear. Here, we investigated the physiological role of PrLD in NFAR2, generated by a splicing variant of the Ilf3 gene. Removal of the PrLD in mice affected the chronic water immersion and restraint stress (WIRS)-sensitive nuclear localization of NFAR2 in the amygdala, a fear-related brain region. Since NFAR2 regulates transcription and translation in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively, we investigated the effects of the PrLD deletion and WIRS on gene expression using RNA-seq and ribosome profiling. Overall design: RNA-seq and ribosome profiling in the amygdala from Ilf3+/+ and Ilf3?PrLD/?PrLD mice under WIRS and control conditions"
