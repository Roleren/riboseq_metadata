abstract
"BSR cells were infected with the Cardiovirus B archetype, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), and mutants thereof, and subjected to ribosome profiling to analyse ribosome collision events on the viral genome. Samples were harvested at 10 hpi by flash-freezing, without cycloheximide pre-treatment. RNase I treatment was carried out, following which ribosomes and enclosed RNA were isolated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. RNA was extracted, ribosomal RNA was removed using Illumina's RiboZero kit, and remaining RNA was gel purified to select fragments 35-65nt long, in order to capture fragments protected by disomes. Fragments were cloned into adapters based on the TruSeq small RNA adapter kit, with an additional seven random nucleotides at 5'-end of the 3'-adapter. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform."
