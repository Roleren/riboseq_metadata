abstract
"DDX3X is a ubiquitously expressed RNA helicase involved in multiple stages of RNA biogenesis. DDX3X is frequently mutated in Burkitt lymphoma but the functional basis for this is unknown. Here, we show that loss-of-function DDX3X mutations are also commonly found in MYC-translocated diffuse large B cell lymphoma and reveal functional co-operation between mutant DDX3X and MYC. We show that DDX3X promotes translation of mRNAs encoding components of the core translational machinery, thereby driving global protein synthesis. Loss-of-function DDX3X mutations moderate MYC-driven global protein synthesis, thereby buffering MYC-induced proteotoxic stress during early lymphomagenesis. Established lymphoma cells subsequently restore full protein synthetic capacity by ectopic expression of DDX3Y, a Y-chromosome homologue that is normally expressed exclusively in testis. These findings highlight the vulnerability of MYC-driven lymphoma to proteotoxic stress and identify an unexpected male-specific mechanism of carcinogenesis, namely the commandeering of a testis-specific Y-chromosome gene to drive full malignant transformation. Overall design: Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq sequencing data in 2 lymphoma cell lines Mutu and U2392 following DDX3X shRNA knockdown at 2 time points: 24h and 48h; RNA-Seq sequencing data comparing DDX3X R475C knockin versus control edited cell line clones"
