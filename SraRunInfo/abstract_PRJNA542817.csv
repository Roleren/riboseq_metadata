abstract
"We use ribosome footprinting to assess the gene expression changes occuring after 10 minutes of heat stress at either 40°C or 42°C compared to non-stressed yeast cells (30°C). We find that between 40°C and 42°C there is a shift in gene expression from the expression of genes harboring long and structured 5'UTRs to the expression of genes harboring thranscripts with short and unstructure 5'UTRs. We performed these experiments for WT yeast cells as well as for mutant yeast cells in which the RNA helicase Ded1 condensates at lower temperatures (Ded1-IDRm). We find upon comparing mutant and WT cells at 42°C, that Ded1-IDRm has increased expression of genes harboring unstructured 5'UTRs and decreased expression of genes harboring structured 5'UTRs. Overall design: Ribosome Footprinting of WT and mutant yeast cells after 10 minutes at 30, 40 or 42°C"
