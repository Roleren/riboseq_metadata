abstract
"Streptomyces are efficient producers of a wide array of bioactive compounds, mostly synthesized by their secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGCs). The smBGCs are tightly controlled by complex regulatory systems at transcriptional and translational levels to effectively utilize precursors supplied by primary metabolism. Thus, dynamic changes in gene expression in response to the cellular status, not only at the transcriptional but also translational levels should be elucidated as a direct reflection of the protein level, rapid downstream response, and cellular energy cost. In this study, RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling were performed for five industrially important Streptomyces species at different growth phases, which are the deep sequencing of total mRNA and only mRNA fragments protected by translating ribosomes, respectively. As a result, sufficient number of high-quality sequencing reads was obtained with high reproducibility. These high-quality RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling data provide a comprehensive understanding of transcriptional and translational landscape across the Streptomyces species, and contribute for facilitating the rational engineering of secondary metabolite production."
