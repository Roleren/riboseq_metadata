abstract
"Yeast mRNA decapping-activators Pat1 and Dhh1 have been implicated in repressing translation and mRNA degardation in glucose-deprived cells, but the specific mRNAs targeted by each factor and their functions in nutrient replete cells are poorly understood. To test this, we performed ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq in WT, pat1D and pat1Ddhh1D. Further, CAGE-Seq and Rpb1-ChIP Seq were employed to determine their role in decapping mediated degradation of mRNAs Overall design: This study includes total 26 samples, 9 for ribosome profiling from triplicates of WT, pat1D and pat1Ddhh1D; 3 from  triplicates of WT. Separately, the same total RNA dhh1D, and pat1D in duplicates,  were subjected to CAGE-Seq (4 samples) and total RNA-Seq (4 samples). pat1D and dhh1D in triplicates were subjected to Rpb1-ChIP seq (6 samples).  All strains were grown in YPD at 30ÂºC till the OD600 ~0.6"
