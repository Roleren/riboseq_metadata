"We performed ribosome profiling of wild-type and loc1- cells.  We found that approximately 1500 genes exhibit increased translational efficiencies in the absence of Loc1, indicating that Loc1 is required for their translational repression. Overall design: Examination of translational efficiencies by comparing ribosome footprints and mRNA abundances in two different cell lines."
