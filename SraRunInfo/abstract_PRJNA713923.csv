abstract
"In this study, we generated nucleotide-resolution translatome as well as transcriptome data of isolated primary cardiomyocytes undergoing hypertrophy. More than 10,000 open reading frames (ORF) were detected from the deep sequencing of ribosome protected fragments orchestrating the shift of translatome in hypertrophied cardiomyocytes.We further identified more than 100 potential micropeptides encoded by uncharacterized small open reading frames (sORFs) in the long noncoding RNA genes. Over two-thirds of these micropeptide candidates were experimentally validated in a random test with three micropeptides showing regulatory function in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via modulating the activities of Oxidative phosphorylation, Calcium signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway.Our study provided a genome-wide overview of the translational controls of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and demonstrated an unrecognized role of micropeptides in cardiomyocyte biology. Overall design: Ribo-seq and RNA-seq of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated with or without PE; RNA-seq of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes infected with ad-sORF or control virus ssRNA-seq data presented here."
