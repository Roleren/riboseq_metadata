"High-dose radiation is the main component of glioblastoma therapy. Unfortunately, radio-resistance is a common problem and a major contributor to tumor relapse. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving response to radiation is critical for identifying regulatory routes that could be targeted to improve treatment response. We conducted an integrated analysis in the U251 and U343 glioblastoma cell lines to map early alterations in the expression of genes at three levels: transcription, splicing, and translation in response to ionizing radiation. Overall design: Expression and Ribosome profilling of U251 and U343 glioblastoma cell lines at three time points T0, T1, and T24. U251 RNA-seq: T0 (2 replicates); T1 (3 replicates); T24 (3 replicates). U343 RNA-seq: T0 (3 replicates); T1( 3 replicates); T24 (3 replicates). U251 Ribo-seq: T0 (2 replicates); T1 (3 replicates); T24 (3 replicates). U343 Ribo-seq: T0 (3 replicates); T1( 3 replicates); T24 (3 replicates)."
