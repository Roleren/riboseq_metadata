abstract
"RNA binding proteins (RBPs) can regulate their target mRNA stability, localization, and translation. Among them, Puf3p is a well-known RBP with intensively studied biology. Nevertheless, the impact of Puf3p on its downstream gene translational regulation still remains to be investigated at the genome level. In this study, we combined ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq in budding yeast S. cerevisiae to investigate Puf3pâ€™s functions."
