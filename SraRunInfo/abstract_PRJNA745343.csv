abstract
"In addition to predominant protein methylation on lysine and arginine residues, histidine also serves as a substrate for the modification. However, a limited number of enzymes responsible for this modification has been reported. Moreover, the biological mission of the histidine methylation has remained poorly understood. Here, we reported that human METTL18 is a histidine methyltransferase for ribosomal protein RPL3 and that the modification specifically slows ribosome traverse on tyrosine codons, allowing proper folding of synthesized proteins. Harnessing in vitro methylation assay with methyl-donor analogue and quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified that His245 of RPL3 is methylated at t-N position by METTL18. Structural comparison of the modified and unmodified ribosomes showed the stoichiometric modification and suggested its role in translation tuning. Indeed, genome-wide ribosome profiling revealed the suppressed ribosomal translocation at tyrosine codons by RPL3 methylation. Because the slower elongation provides enough time for nascent protein folding, RPL3 methylation protects cells from cellular aggregation of Tyr-rich proteins. Our results reveal histidine methylation as an example of “ribosome code”, which ensures proteome integrity in cells. Overall design: Ribosome profiling"
