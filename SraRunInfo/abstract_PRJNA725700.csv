"To provide a comprehensive translational regulation profile and allele-specific translation efficiency in rice (Oryza sativa), one of the most important food crops worldwide, we conducted Ribo-seq experiments in three Asian xian rice (Oryza sativa xian/indica) varieties, Minghui 63 (MH63), Zhenshan 97 (ZS97), their elite hybrid Shanyou 63 (SY63), and their three respective tissues, leaf, panicle and root."
