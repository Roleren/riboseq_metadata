abstract
CHX is an inhibitor of translation elongation often used in ribosome profiling experiments.  There is evidence that CHX treatment of cells may cause artefacts in the distribution of ribosomes on mRNAs.  We investigate this possibility in S. pombe by performing ribosome profiling in the presence and absence of this drug.
