abstract
"LARP1 has been proposed to control the translation of TOP mRNAs downstrteam of mTORC1. Here we used ribosome profiling to analyze transcriptome-wide changes in translation following mTOR inhibition in wild-type HEK-293T cells and cells where LARP1 (sgLARP1) or LARP1 and its homologue LARP1B (sgLARP1/1B) have been deleted using CRISPR/Cas9. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq datasets from wild-type HEK-293T, sgLARP1, and sgLARP1/1B cells treated for 2 h with 250 nM of the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1. Please note that the 'larp1dko_*_RPF_rep*' processed data (e.g. DKO_DMSOa_RPF_unique.htseqcounts.txt) was generated together with the corresponding *reseq sample (e.g. GSM3889093 and GSM4146393) and is linked to the LP* sample records (e.g. GSM3889093 LP: larp1dko_dmso_RPF_rep1)."
