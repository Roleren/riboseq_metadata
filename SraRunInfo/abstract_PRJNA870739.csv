"To see a possible effect of PI3K inhibition on a physiological warm temperature shift (WTS, 35°C to 38.5°C)-induced ribosomal accumulation on the Per2 minimal uORF, we performed Ribo-seq using dexamethasone-synchronized WTS-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast cells with or without 17ß-hydroxy wortmannin (wortm) treatment at a circadain rising phase of Per2. Overall design: We used Dex-synchronized WTS-treated MEF cells treated with or without wortm. WTS and wortm was applied 24 h after Dex synchronization (i.e., circadian rising phase of Per2). Two independent experiments were performed."
