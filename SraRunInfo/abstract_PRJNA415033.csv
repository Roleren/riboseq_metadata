abstract
"DHX36 is a ATP-dependent, 3´-5´ RNA helicase of the DEAH family. Previous publications reported this helicase to associate with AU-rich elements and to specifically unwind G-quadruplex structures. Here, we performed Ribosome footprintin in triplicats of HEK293 wildtype cells and DHX36-KO-HEK293 cells to identify changes in ribosome occupancy on mRNAs upon presence or absence of this helicase. After sequencing and mapping to the human genome at nucleotide-resolution level we analysed the coverage of ribosomes on target mRNAs, identified in this study (see PAR-CLIP). Our analyses show that only minor changes upon DHX36 knockout can be observed. Overall design: Examination of ribosome footprints in HEK293 wildtype cells and DHX36-KO-HEK293 cells"
