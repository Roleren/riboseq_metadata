abstract
We used Illlumina Artseq Ribo Profile to perform ribosome footprinting on the above cell lines Overall design: We followed the manufacturer's protocol: Cells were treated with cycloheximide (0.1 mg/ml) to inhibit translation; total RNA and ribosome-protected RNA fragments were isolated and library preped for sequencing simultaneously.
