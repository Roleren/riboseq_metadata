abstract
"DDX41 has been suggested to be involved in RNA splicing and ribosome biogenesis, and mutations of the gene is found in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. In this analysis, we performed comprehensive translation analysis by taking advantage of Ribo-seq for K562 cells infected with shRNA targeting DDX41 or treated with CX5461, an RNA polymerase I inhibitor."
