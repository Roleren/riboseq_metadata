abstract
"Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC) pathways protect cells from toxicity caused by incomplete protein products resulting from translation of damaged or problematic mRNAs. Extensive work in yeast has identified highly conserved mechanisms that lead to the degradation of the faulty mRNA and partially synthesized polypeptide. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9-based screening to search for additional RQC strategies in mammals. We found that failed translation leads to specific inhibition of translation initiation on that message. This negative feedback loop is mediated by two translation inhibitors, GIGYF2 and 4EHP. Both model substrates and growth-based assays established that inhibition of additional rounds of translation acts in concert with known RQC pathways to prevent buildup of toxic proteins. Inability to block translation of faulty mRNAs, and subsequent accumulation of partially synthesized polypeptides, could explain the neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders observed in mice and humans with compromised GIGYF2 function. Overall design: This datasets consists of paired ribosome profiling and RNA-seq datasets collected in replicate after the CRISPRi-mediated knockdown of NEMF, ZNF598, EIF4E2, GIGYF2, and non-targeting negative controls."
