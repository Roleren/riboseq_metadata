abstract
"Aiming to gain brain region- and cell type-specific resolution in gene expression profiling during PD pathogenesis, we applied the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technique to enrich the ribosome-bound mRNA of DaNs, microglia and astrocyte, for RNA-Seq and analysis in a mouse MPTP model of PD. Overall design: We performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of 3 different cells at two regions."
