abstract
"We performed ribosome profiling to assess the translation elongation on translating RNA in HBE, A549, and H1299. We detected the new proteins in the cells. Overall design: HBE, A549 and H1299 cells were cultured in the complete DMEM medium. We detected and analyzed the new proteins with ribosome profiling."
