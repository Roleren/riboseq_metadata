"Several mouse lines  have been developed to target microglia genetically; however, they lack specificity. Here, we use ribosome tagging and immunoprecipitation coupled to RNA-Seq in our newly developed mouse line to define the true microglial translatome. Overall design: Ribosome-mRNA complexes were isolated from whole brains from P2ry12-CreER; RPL22HA mice by immunoprecipitation. Transcript enrichment was evaluated by RNA-Seq of transcripts in the input and in the immunoprecipitated fractions."
