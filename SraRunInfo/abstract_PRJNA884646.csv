"Neurons use local protein synthesis to support their morphological complexity, which requires independent control across multiple subcellular compartments up to the level of individual synapses. Here we identify a signaling pathway that regulates the local synthesis of proteins required to form excitatory synapses on parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons in the mouse cerebral cortex. This process involves regulation of the TSC subunit 2 (Tsc2) by the Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ErbB4), which enables local control of mRNA translation in a cell type-specific and synapse type-specific manner. Ribosome-associated mRNA profiling reveals a molecular program of synaptic proteins downstream of ErbB4 signaling required to form excitatory inputs on PV+ interneurons. Thus, specific connections use local protein synthesis to control synapse formation in the nervous system. Overall design: RNAseq of ribosome-associated RNAs from P15 synaptosomes of MGE-derived interneurons in 4 samples from ErbB4 conditional knockout mice and 4 samples from control mice"
