abstract
"Study is aimed to understand translation regulation of mRNA in low and high polyamines in S. cerevisiae. mRNA seq and Ribosome profiling were performed in yeast cells, in duplicates, under low (0 spermidine) and high (10 ÂµM) spermidine. Translation efficiency was calculated (low vs high SPD) and GO analysis reveals 23 transporters as the only class undergo TE downregulation in high SPD condition. Further, we investigated role of these 23 transporters in polyamine transport and identified HOL1 as the high affinity polyamine transporter. This study further show that HOL1 is under polyamine control of translation regulation through conserved fungal uORF MLLLPS*. Overall design: To understand mRNA translation regulation in low and high polyamines, ribosome profiling and total RNAseq were performed in duplicates under two conditions. In total, 8 datasets are generated, 4 of Riboseq and 4 of RNAseq."
