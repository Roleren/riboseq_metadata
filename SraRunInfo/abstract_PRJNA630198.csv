abstract
Identification of genome-wide translational changes during prion disease via cell-type specific ribosome profiling. Overall design: Mice expressing GFP-tagged ribosome  in prion disease relevant cell types were inoculated with non-infectious brain homogenate or prions and sacrificed at different time points during disease progression.
