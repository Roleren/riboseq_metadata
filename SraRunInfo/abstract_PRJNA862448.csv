abstract
To investigate the effect of Decitabine and SB939 treatment on the expression of endoretroviral elements. We treated NCI-H1299 cells with DMSO or a combination of Decitabine and SB939 and performed Ribo-seq. This data was used to identify novel ORFs expressed from endoretroviral elements derived transcripts. Overall design: Ribosomal footprinting analysis of Ribo-seq data for NCI-H1299 cells treated with DMSO or a combination of Decitabine and SB939
