abstract
"We identified an oncomicropeptide that was enriched on ribosomes and regulated translation. We further performed the ribosome profiling and RNA-seq libraries sequenced to globally identify the mRNAs that the peptie targeted. Interestingly, the ribo-seq data has shown that a large number of mRNAs were significantly downregulated in the peptide-knockdown samples. Finally, we discovered that high expression of the peptide supported a specific translation program to facilitate cancer progression. Overall design: Sh-NC and sh-Speptide MOLM-13 cells used"
