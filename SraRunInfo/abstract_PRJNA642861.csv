abstract
"Cancer cells are addicted to ribosome biogenesis and high levels of translation. Thus, differential inhibition of cancer cells can be achieved by targeting aspects of ribosome biogenesis or ribosome function. Using RiboMeth-seq for profiling of the ~112 2'-O-Me sites in human ribosomal RNA, we demonstrated pronounced hypomethylation at several sites in patient-derived DLBCL cell lines with a more severe perturbation in ABC-DLBCL compared to GBC-DLBCL. We extended our analysis to tumor samples from patients and demonstrated significant changes to the ribosomal modification pattern that appeared to consist of cell growth-related as well as tumor-specific changes. Sites of hypomethylation in patient samples are discussed as potential drug targets, using as an example a site in the small subunit (SSU-C1440) located in a ribosomal substructure that can be linked to DLBCL pathogenesis. Overall design: Cell cultures were analyzed in biological triplicates, tissue and tumor samples in technical triplicates."
