Then cells were harvested by pretreatment with chloramphenicol to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml for 2 minutes followed by rapid filtration by using a 500ml 0.45um PES filter system (Celltreat). Cells were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen together with 0.65 ml lysis buffer (Oh et al. 2011). The frozen cells were pulverized 6 times at 15 Hz for 3 min by a mixer mill (Retsch MM400). The grinding jars were re-chilled in liquid nitrogen to keep the cells frozen between each cycle. After the pulverized cells were recovered, small scoopful was saved for bacterial transcript enrichment. Footprinting and monosome isolation were performed as described (Oh et al. 2011). Briefly, the pulverized cells were thawed. The clarified lysates were treated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase, Worthington Biochemical Corp). Monosomes were isolated by sucrose gradient fractionation. mRNA footprints were purified with acid phenol and chloroform extraction, and isopropanol precipitation.
