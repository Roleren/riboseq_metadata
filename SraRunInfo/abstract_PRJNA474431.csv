abstract
"Under crowded, nutrient-limiting conditions, growth in the marine chordate O. dioica arrests until favorable conditions return. We profiled translation genome-wide using ribosome profiling in O. dioica during growth arrest and growth arrest recovery. We found that initial recovery is independent of nutrient-responsive, trans-spliced genes, suggesting that animal density is the primary trigger for the resumption of development in this species. Overall design: Ribosome-protected RNA fragments and total RNA extracted from animals during growth arrest and half an hour after release from arrest in two biological replicates sequenced on two Illumina flow cells"
