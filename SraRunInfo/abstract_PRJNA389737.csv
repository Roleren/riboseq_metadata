abstract
"The present study was primarily aimed at expanding the scope of the previous analyses, which focused largely on AGO1-miRNA interactions with total polysomes and MBPs, respectively. Our larger aim was to comprehensively analyze which, among the multiple AGO effector proteins and the numerous cellular sRNA classes of Arabidopsis, interact with the translational machinery. Overall design: 6 samples examined: translating-ribosome affinity immunopurification (TRAP) and duplicates of polysomal and monosomal ribosomal profiling in inflorescences, and small RNA-seq in seedlings."
