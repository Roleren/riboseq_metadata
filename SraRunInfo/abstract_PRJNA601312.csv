abstract
"We provide a series of chromatin and transcriptomic profiles to establish the short-term and long-term effects of cisplatin treatment in ovarian cancer A2780 cells. Overall design: All ChIP-Seq, GRO-seq, RNA-seq, and ribosome-profiling experiments were designed to understand the effects of cisplatin on 6 different layers of gene-expression regulation in cancer cells."
