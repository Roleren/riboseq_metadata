abstract
"Methods: U2OS mRNA profiles of control siRNA(siControl) and siCDK12 were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level. Total RNA-Seq was used for normalzation of RIP-Seq signals.Results: We report the application of RNA-immunoprecipitation-based sequencing for high-throughput profiling of mRNA abundence in mammalian cells. We generated genome-wide views of translation rate in CDK12-depleted U2OS cells in comparion to mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin treatment. We find that significant overlap and high corelation of change in eIF4G-associated mRNAs between two condition, rapamycin treatment and siCDK12 transfected cells. This study provides a role of CDK12 in translation control of  mammalian cell. Overall design: Ribosome footprinting followed by sequencing (Ribo-Seq) in 2 different treatments in U2OS cells."
