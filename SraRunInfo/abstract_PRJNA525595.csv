abstract
"Mycobacteria encode several additional alternative ribosomal proteins (AltRP) and the funtion of AltRP invovling in translation is little known. In this study, we investigate the different translation landscape of AltRibo and CanRibo and found AltRibo have a relative 5' reads accumlation and preferential codon usage. Overall design: Using specific affinity tag to enrich different ribosome and subject to ribosome profiling to determine different translation landscape of AltRibo and CanRibo in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Please note that processed data was generated from multiple samples/replicates as indicated in the corresponding sample description field."
