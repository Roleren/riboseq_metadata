abstract
Ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) (maps positions of translating ribosomes on the transcriptome) and RNA-Seq (quantifies the transcriptome) analysis of African green monkey (Vero E6) cells and Aedes albopictus (C6/36) cells infected with Zika Virus (ZIKV) strain PE243. Cells were harvested at 24 h post infection (p.i.) and Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared and deep sequenced.
