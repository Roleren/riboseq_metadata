abstract
"Limitation for amino acids is thought to regulate translation in mammalian cells primarily by signaling through the kinases mTORC1 and GCN2. We find that limitation for the amino acid arginine causes a selective loss of tRNA charging, which regulates translation through ribosome pausing at two of six arginine codons. Interestingly, limitation for leucine, an essential and abundant amino acid in protein, results in little or no ribosome pausing. Chemical and genetic perturbation of mTORC1 and GCN2 signaling revealed that their robust response to leucine limitation prevents ribosome pausing, while an insufficient response to arginine limitation led to loss of arginine tRNA charging and ribosome pausing. Codon-specific ribosome pausing decreased protein production and triggered premature ribosome termination without significantly reducing mRNA levels. Together, our results suggest that amino acids which are not optimally sensed by the mTORC1 and GCN2 pathways still regulate translation through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism based on synonymous codon usage. Overall design: Ribosome profiling was performed in HEK293T, HCT116, or HeLa cells during limitation for leucine or arginine for 3 or 6 hours to determine the effect of limiting single amino acid levels of ribosome elongation kinetics at the cognate codons. The same cell lines grown in nutrient-rich conditions were used as a control. These experiments were repeated in HEK293T cells with 250 nM Torin1, in cells stably expressing a flag-tagged wild-type or Q99L mutant RagB-GTPase or hrGFP, and in a GCN2 knockout cell line to determine the role of the mTORC1 and GCN2 pathways."
