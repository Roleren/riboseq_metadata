"Abstract : ""A hallmark of the cellular response to environmental stress is the formation of stress granules.  Stress granules are RNA-protein assemblies that provide an adaptive response to stress; however, the basis for their formation and how they contribute to the stress response remains incompletely understood.  Here we show that the mRNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a mark that targets mRNAs to stress granules.  We find that m6A mRNAs are highly enriched in stress granules, and this is mediated by m6A-induced liquid-liquid phase separation of the YTHDF family of m6A-binding proteins.  These proteins bind poly-methylated m6A mRNAs, causing them to form liquid droplets that partition into stress granules. Moreover, disrupting either m6A or YTHDF proteins prevents stress granule formation.""  The goal of this experiment is to understand how recruitment of m6A mRNA to stress granules influences the translational response to heat shock. Result: we found that m6A-containing mRNA are preferentially repressed during stress, and that m6A is required for translational recovery after heat shock Overall design: Ribosome profiling were generated from two biological replicates of wild type and Mettl14 -/- mES cells heat socked at 42Â°C for 30 min or not and at a recovery time point of 1h after heat shock"
