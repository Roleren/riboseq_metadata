"To investigate the role of METTL3-mediated m6A modification and mRNA translation, we performed m6A-sequencing and Ribosome-nascent chain (RNC)-RNA sequencing in high glucose treated control or METTL3 knockdown HTR8/SVneo cells. Overall design: m6A-seq and Ribosome-nascent chain complex-RNA sequencing of the METTL3 knockdown and control HTR8/SVneo cells with treatment of 30 mM glucose for 24 hours"
