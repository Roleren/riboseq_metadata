"Mouse primary B cells were treated with 10 uM GC7 or vehicle control and processed for ribosome profiling. During harvesting, samples were spiked with S. cerevisiae lysate containing stable polysomes. Overall design: Examination of ribosome-protected fragment abundances and distributions in drug-treated and control cells. N = 1."
