abstract
"Control and U1 AMO were transfected into Hela cells, Ribosome-associated RNAs were purified and sequenced in Novaseq platform.To compare the translation efficiency, mRNA-seq were performed in parallel. Overall design: To understand the ribosome-binding profile of mRNAs in control and U1 AMO treated HeLa cells, we carried out Ribo-seq analysis in control and U1 AMO treated HeLa cells. To compare the translation efficiency, we performed mRNA-seq analysis in parallel."
