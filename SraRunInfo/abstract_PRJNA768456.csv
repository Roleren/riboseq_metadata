abstract
"We present ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq data for the wild type BY4742 S. cerevisiae strain, and strains with the complete individual deletions of the GIR2 and PUB1 genes. Overall design: Yeast cells of 3 different S. cerevisiae strains, namely: wt, gir2?, pub1? were maintained in YPD media. The libraries were sequenced, resulting in 14 RNA-Seq and 12 Ribo-Seq data sets."
