abstract
"We measured protein translation (by ribosome profiling) and RNA levels (by polyA-enriched RNA-seq) in Cryptococcus neoformans strain H99 and Cryptococcus neoformans strain JEC21. This is the first transcriptome-wide map of translation in this species complex. Overall design: Matched ribosome profiling and RNA-seq from 6 biological samples: 2x wild-type H99 and 2 deletion mutants (Ago1, Gwo1),  and 1x wild-type JEC21 and 1x deletion mutant (Ago1)."
