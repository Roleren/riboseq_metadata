abstract
"We present ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq data for the wild type BY4742 S. cerevisiae strain, and strains with the complete individual deletions of the TMA46, STM1 and YGR054W genes. Overall design: Yeast cells of 4 different S. cerevisiae strains, namely: wt, tma46?, eif2a?, stm1? were maintained in YPD media. The libraries were sequenced, resulting in 16 RNA-Seq and 16 Ribo-Seq data sets."
