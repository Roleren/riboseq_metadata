abstract
"We report the presence of extensive, transcriptionally controlled oscillations in the C. elegans, developmental transcriptome. Furthermore, using ribosome profiling, we show that these oscillating transcripts are actively translated. Overall design: Examination of three timecourses that were collected over C. elegans development and analyzed by RNA-seq of mRNA libraries"
