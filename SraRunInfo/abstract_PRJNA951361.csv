abstract
Nat10 is required for sculpting the maternal transcriptome through timely degradation of polyA tail mRNAs during the Maternal-to-Zygotic transition(MZT) Overall design: We used WT and ZP3 conditional knockout samples for Ribo-seq through tamoxifen injection for 3 days. For WT RIP-seq we used C57BL/6J
