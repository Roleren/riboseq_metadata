abstract
"piRNAs can derive from transposable elements (TEs), long non-coding RNAs, or the 3'UTR of mRNAs, the last being the least characterized out of the three piRNA classes. In this study, we systematically defined the regulation, biogenesis and function of the 3'UTR piRNAs that are expressed throughout mouse spermatogenesis. These piRNAs are regulated by A-MYB transcription factors, and their precursors are bifunctional mRNAs which are processed into piRNAs after pioneer rounds of translation. This dataset includes high-throughput sequencing data that have been used in this study. Overall design: High-throughput sequencing data including RNAseq, small RNa-seq, Ribo-seq and Degradome sequencing of mouse and rooster testis. All sequencing data were sequenced on Illumina platform."
