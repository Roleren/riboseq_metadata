abstract
"mRNA function is influenced by modifications that modulate canonical nucleobase behavior. We show that a single modification mediates distinct impacts on mRNA translation in a position-dependent manner. While cytidine acetylation (ac4C) within protein-coding sequences stimulates translation, ac4C within 5'UTRs impacts protein synthesis at the level of initiation. 5'UTR acetylation promotes initiation at upstream sequences, competitively inhibiting annotated start codons. Acetylation further directly impedes initiation at optimal AUG contexts: ac4C within AUG-flanking Kozak sequences reduced initiation in base-resolved transcriptome-wide HeLa results, and in vitro utilizing substrates with site-specific ac4C incorporation. Cryo-EM of mammalian 80S initiation complexes revealed ac4C in the -1-position adjacent to an AUG start codon disrupts an interaction between C and hypermodified t6A at nucleotide 37 of the initiator tRNA. These findings demonstrate the impact of RNA modifications on nucleobase function at a molecular level and introduce mRNA acetylation as a factor regulating translation in a location-specific manner. Overall design: Detection of acetylated cytidine in RNA with a novel method (RedaC:T-seq), via chemical reduction of ac4C with sodium borohydride.  Ribo-Seq after Harringtonine treatment to analyze effects on translation initation. RNA sequencing of polysome fractions."
