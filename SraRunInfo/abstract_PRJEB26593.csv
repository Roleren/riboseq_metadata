abstract
"Host cell gene expression response to a bacterial infection can involve changes at the transcriptional and/or translational levels. To discriminate between these two levels of regulations, we have analyzed the translatome by ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq), and transcriptome by RNA-Seq analysis, of a human epithelial colon adenocarcinoma cell line (LoVo ATCC CCL-229) along a 0- to 10-h time-course of infection by Listeria monocytogenes strain LL195."
