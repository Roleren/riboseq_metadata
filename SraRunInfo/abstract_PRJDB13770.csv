abstract
"Total RNAs and ribosome footprints were extracted from 3-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown under darkness and then irradiated with blue light for 3 hours. Using them, RNA-seq and ribosome profiling libraries were constructed and sequenced by HiSeq X platform. Seedlings of wild type, cry1cry2 and hy5 mutants and wild type plants treated with DMSO and chloroplast inhibitors, DCMU and norflurazon, were applied for the analysis."
