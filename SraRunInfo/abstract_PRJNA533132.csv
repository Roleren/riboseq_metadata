Ribosome profiling from monosome and polysome fractions of serum or amino acid starved HEK293 cells Overall design: Human embryonic kindney cells were subjected to 2h of serum or 1h of amino acid starvation. Ribonucleoprotein complexes were separated on polysome gradients. Ribosome protected fragments were purified from pooled monosome and polysome fractions.
