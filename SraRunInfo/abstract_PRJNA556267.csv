abstract
Determination of translation efficiency of recoded neuramindase mRNA transcripts in transiently transfected HEK 293T cells. Overall design: Expression plasmids containing recoded IAV neuramindase were transfected into HEK 293T cells and translational dynamics of neuraminidase mRNA was determined by ribosome footprint-profiling experiments
