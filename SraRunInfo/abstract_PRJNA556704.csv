Looking at ribosome distribution and translational efficiency in control conditions in HEK293 cell line. Combining this information with our other datasets from HEK293 cells has allowed us to look at ribosome occupancy of specific groups of mRNAs Overall design: Ribosome Profiling conducted in HEK293 cells treated with control siRNA. Ribo-zero treated total RNA for the same samples is also included.
