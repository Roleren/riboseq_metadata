"Translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) methods allow cell-specific recovery of polyribosome-associated RNAs by genetic tagging of ribosomes in selected cell populations. In this study, we purified and analysed the polyribosome-associated RNA fraction of zebrafish embryoÂ´s retinas at 22 hours post-fertilization. To this aim, we generated a transgenic strain in which the tagged ribosomes expression is restricted to the retina cells due to the activity of a specific promoter. Overall design: Analysis of ribosome-associated mRNAs in zebrafish retina cells"
