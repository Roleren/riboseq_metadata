"Translation regulation occurs largely during initiation. Currently, translation initiation can be studied in vitro, but these systems lack features present in vivo and on endogenous mRNAs. Here we develop selective 40S footprinting for visualizing initiating 40S ribosomes on endogenous mRNAs in vivo. It pinpoints where on an mRNA initiation factors join the ribosome to act, and where they leave. We discover that in human cells most scanning ribosomes remain attached to the 5' cap. Consequently, only one ribosome scans a 5'UTR at a time, and 5'UTR length affects translation efficiency. We discover that eIF3B, eIF4G1 and eIF4E remain on translating 80S ribosomes with a decay half-length of ~12 codons. Hence ribosomes retain these initiation factors while translating short upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs), providing an explanation for how ribosomes can re-initiate translation after uORFs in humans. This method will be of use for studying translation initiation mechanisms in vivo. Overall design: Selective and total 40S and 80S footprinting was carried out on HeLa and NIH3T3 cells. Selective datasets were produced for factors eIF3B, eIF4E, eIF2S1 and eIF4G1."
