abstract
Purpose: Study the changes in mRNA translation upon silencing of lncRNA TINCR Methods: Primary melanoma cell line WM902B was transduced with lientiviruses expressing Scrambled and TINCR directed shRNA hairpins Results: we found that TINCR silencing induces activation of ATF4 translation Overall design: Analysis of differential translation in shScrambled and shTINCR expressing WM902B cells
