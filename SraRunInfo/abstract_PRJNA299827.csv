abstract
We performed ribosome profiling in Cystic Fibrosis Bronchial Epithelial cells which data set is used to calcualte codon-specific ribosome occupancy using the approach described by Lareau et al. eLife 2014. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of cells at steady state. 3 biological replicates.
