abstract
"Queuosine (Q) is a modified nucleoside at the wobble position of specific tRNAs. In mammals, queuosinylation is facilitated by queuine uptake from the gut microbiota and is introduced into tRNA by the QTRT1-QTRT2 enzyme complex. By establishing a Qtrt1 knockout mouse model, we discovered that the loss of QtRNA leads to learning and memory deficits. Ribo-Seq analysis in the hippocampus of Qtrt1-deficient mice revealed not only stalling of ribosomes on Q-decoded codons but also a global imbalance in translation elongation speed between codons that engage in weak and strong interactions with their cognate anticodons. While Qdependent molecular and behavioral phenotypes were identified in both sexes, female mice were affected more severely than males. Proteomics analysis confirmed deregulation of synaptogenesis and neuronal morphology. Together, our findings provide a link between tRNA modification and brain functions and reveal an unexpected role of protein synthesis in sex-dependent cognitive performance. Overall design: Cytoplasmic RNA and Cytoplasmic RNA protected by ribosomes from RNase I (Ribonuclease I) cleavage, were sequenced. Small RNA libraries were performed according to the protocol using NEB NEXT Small RNA library Prep Set for Illumina (Multiplex Compatible) E7330, and size-selected (120-170 base pairs) before sequencing."
