abstract
"We demonstrate that global effects of TRIM71 on the cellular transcriptome of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are largely attributable to its RNA binding activity. We observe that target repression by TRIM71 in mESCs occurs predominantly through transcript degradation. We identify a core set of targets consistently regulated by TRIM71 in different human and mouse cell lines. Overall design: RNA-seq of WT (10 replicates), TRIM71 KO (10 replicates), TRIM71 RING_mut (TRIM71RING; 5 replicates), and TRIM71 NHL_mut(TRIM71NHL, 5 replicates) mESC cells. RNA-seq of WT (8 replicates) and TRIM71 KO (8 replicates) Ne4C cells. RNA-seq of WT (3 replicates) and TRIM71 KO (3 replicates) Huh-7 cells. Ribosome profiling of WT (4 replicates), and TRIM71 KO (4 replicates) mES cells."
