abstract
"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is an emerging gene regulatory mechanism that impacts antitumour immunity; however, the functional relevance of m6A modifiers in antitumour T cells is unknown. In the present study, we uncovered an effector T cell-specific expression and distribution pattern of the m6A reader YTHDF2, which supports T cell-based tumour immunity and therapy efficacy. This project presents raw dataset from 1. scRNA-seq from YTHDF2cko and YTHDF2fl/fl mc38 tumor infiltrating T cells. 2. RIP-seq and meRIP-seq from wildtype mouse primary CD8 T cells.3. ATAC-seq, Ribo-seq and Cut &amp;RUN from CD8 T cells from YTHDF2cko and YTHDF2fl/fl mice. 4. RIP-seq , meRIP-seq and ATAC-seq from Jurkat cell line."
