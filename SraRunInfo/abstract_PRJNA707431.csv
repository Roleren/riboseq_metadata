abstract
"Human ribosomes are made of around 80 ribosomal proteins (RPs) and four ribosomal RNAs. To explore gene expression regulation by RPs at the transcriptional and translational levels, parallel RNA-seq and Ribo-seq were conducted in A549 cells after knockdown of individual RP. Overall design: 75 human RPs were knocked-down by specific siRNAs one-by-one in A549 cells, and the RP-deficient cells were subjected to parallel RNA-seq and Ribo-seq. Gene expression in RP-deficient cells was compared with that in the control cells treated by non-targeting siRNAs. In total, we prepared 105 Ribo-seq libraries, with 105 paired RNA-seq libraries, for 78 human RPs as well as 8 control samples, where biological replicates were performed for 16 RPs and for 3 control samples."
