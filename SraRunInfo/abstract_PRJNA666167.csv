abstract
"BCDIN3D is an RNA modifying enzyme that methylates specific precursor microRNAs and tRNAHis. In addition to breast cancer, BCDIN3D may also be linked to metabolism, as its gene locus is associated with obesity and T2D. In order to uncover metabolic pathways regulated by BCDIN3D in cancer, we performed an unbiased analysis of the metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome of breast cancer cells depleted for BCDIN3D. Intersection of these analyses showed that BCDIN3D-depleted cells have increased levels of Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphate (F1,6-BP), the last six-carbon glycolytic intermediate accompanied by reduced glycolytic capacity. Overall design: We performed combined RNA-Seq, miRNA-seq, and ribosome profiling in shBCDIN3D MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells"
