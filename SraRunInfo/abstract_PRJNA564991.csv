abstract
"The goal of this study is to identify the determinants of translation initiation in a representative of the Bacteroidetes, namely Flavobacterium johnsoniae. The Bacteroidetes lack Shine-Dalgarno sequences, normally associated with translation initiation, which is why studying translation initiation in Bacteroidetes is able to reveal other determinants of translational regulation."
