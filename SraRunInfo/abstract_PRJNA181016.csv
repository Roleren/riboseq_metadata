"Translational control permits cells to respond swiftly to changing environment. Rapid attenuation of global protein synthesis under stress conditions has been largely ascribed to the inhibition of translation initiation. To monitor the co-translational response to proteotoxic stress especially during elongation stage, we performed ribosome profiling (deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) and investigated the roles of chaperone molecules in this process."
