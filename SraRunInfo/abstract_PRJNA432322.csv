"Purpose: We use the ribosome profiling protocol to understand why EF4 confers resistance to tellurite and how tellurite affects ribosome. Methods: We used ribosome profiling and transcriptomic data to analyze mainly by plastid software. The ribosome were purified by sucrose gradient separation. Results: Using polysome profile and sequencing data, we found that tellurite disables the ribosome subunits to form a functional 70S ribosome and reduces the ribosome density after tellurite exposure. We also found that tellurite influences the ribosome reaching to stop codon. Tellurite shortened the ribosome protected fragment, this process was mediated by EF4. EF4 mediated more gene expression including these known tellurite resistance genes to confer tellurite resistance. Tellurite also induced many differential gene expression. Conclusions: Tellurite exerts its toxicity on ribosome by disabling 70S ribosome formation, reaching to stop codon, and inducing differential gene expression. Overall design: Ribosome footprints and mRNAs from BW25113 (WT) and JW2553 (?EF4) strains that were treated with potassium tellurite and sequenced, in two replicates, using Illumina HiSeq 2500"
