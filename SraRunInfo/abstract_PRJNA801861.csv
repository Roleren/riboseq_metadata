abstract
"Studies on biological functions of RNA modifications such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA have sprung up in recent years, while the roles of N1-methyladenosine (m1A) in cancer progression remain largely unknown. We find m1A demethylase ALKBH3 can regulate the glycolysis of cancer cells via a demethylation activity dependent manner. Specifically, sequencing and functional studies confirm that ATP5D, one of the most important subunit of ATP synthase, is involved in m1A demethylase ALKBH3-regulated glycolysis of cancer cells. The m1A modified A71 at the Exon 1 of ATP5D negatively regulates its translation elongation via increasing the binding with YTHDF1/eRF1 complex, which facilitates the release of mRNA from ribosome complex. m1A also regulates mRNA stability of E2F1, which directly binds with ATP5D promoter to initiate its transcription. Targeted specific demethylation of ATP5D m1A by dm1ACRISPR system can significantly increase the expression of ATP5D and glycolysis of cancer cells. In vivo data confirm the roles of m1A/ATP5D in tumor growth and cancer progression. Our study for the first time reveals a crosstalk of mRNA m1A modification and cell metabolism, which expands the understanding of such interplays that are essential for cancer therapeutic application. Overall design: Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq in Human HeLa WT(n=2) and HeLa ALKBH3-KO(n=2), then caculated the quantity and efficiency of translation"
