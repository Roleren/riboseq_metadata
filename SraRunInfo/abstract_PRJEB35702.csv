"Common carp (~0.5kg) previously held for over 3 months at 25°C were randomly placed into two large aquarium tanks, one which remained throughout at 25°C (control) and the other was cooled over 3 days to 11°C for 23 days.  Replicate specimens from both tanks were then killed at up to 17 timepoints after cooling and kidney tissue was sampled, and ribosomal footprints were quantified as a function of time after cooling using Ribo-Seq."
