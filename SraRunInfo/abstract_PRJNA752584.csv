abstract
"We report the genome-wide impact of rhythmic P-eIF2a levels in vivo by performing ribosome profiling and RNA-seq in Neurospora crassa samples grown over a circadian time course. We identified candidate genes which showed rhyhmic ribosome occupancy in WT cells but lost rhythms in mRNA levels and ribosome occupancy in the clock mutant Dfrq, eIF2a  kinase knockout Dcpc-3, and constitutively active kinase mutant cpc-3c cells. Select mRNAs harbor a P-body localization motif identified by MEME and MEME Suite's GOMo function. P-body localization of the target mRNAs provides an attractive mechanism for explaining translational rhythms from otherwise arrhythmic mRNAs. Overall design: Ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) (done in parallel with RNA-seq) of Neurospora crassa WT, clock mutant Dfrq, eIF2a  kinase knockout Dcpc-3, and constitutively active kinase mutant cpc-3c mycelia, grown over a circadian time course. Each time point has a duplicate."
