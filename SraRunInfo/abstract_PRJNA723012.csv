abstract
Ribosome Profiling was used to evaluated whether changes in abundance of tRNAIleUAU and tRNAIleGAU would affect codon dependent translation and quantify dwell times over isoleucyl codons Overall design: Examination of ribosomal occupancy of isoleucyl codon enriched transcripts under Isoleucine tRNA modulation (increased tRNAIleUAU expression and decreased tRNAIleGAU expression via CRISPRi)
