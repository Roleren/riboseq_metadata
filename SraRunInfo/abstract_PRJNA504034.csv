abstract
"Here we generated a draft annotation for the newly assembled Chinese hamster genome and used RNA-Seq, proteomics, and Ribo-Seq to experimentally annotate the genome. We identified 4,333 new proteins compared to the hamster RefSeq protein annotation and 2,503 novel translational events (e.g., alternative splices, mutations, novel splices). Finally, we used this pipeline to identify the source of translated retroviruses contaminating recombinant products from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, including 131 type-C retroviruses, thus enabling future efforts to eliminate retroviruses by reducing the costs incurred with retroviral particle clearance. In summary, the improved annotation provides a more accurate platform for guiding CHO cell line engineering, including facilitating the interpretation of omics data, defining of cellular pathways, and engineering of complex phenotypes."
