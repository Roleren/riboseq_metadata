abstract
"This study demonstrates the dichotomous activities of APRIL and BAFF in MM and DLBCL, which can be safely targeted by an engineered fusion protein designed to trap both ligands with ultrahigh binding affinity. Overall design: Comparative ribosome and gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for U266 multiple myeloma cells and its knockdown derivatives (siBCMA)."
