abstract
"We used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete the DBP1 ORF in SK1 budding yeast cells. We then used ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq to observe gene expression profiles of wild-type and dbp1? cells during meiosis. Overall design: Cells were grown as described in Powers et al., 2022. Samples were collected 6h post transfer to SPO media. Two biological replicates are included for each genotype."
