abstract
"In gene expression, DNA is transcribed to mRNA, and mRNA is translated to protein. In these steps, translation is one of the important steps to determine the protein abundance. To evaluate translation efficiencies, ribosome profiling is reported in previous study. This method is based on deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments, and provides a ""snapshot"" of all the ribosomes abundance at a specific time point. This information provide the ribosome position or ribosome occupancy on mRNAs. Thus, we conducted ribosome profiling using 3 day after inoculation of Arabidopsis T87 cultured cell to evaluate translation efficiencies and analyze the relationships between sequence feature and translation process."
