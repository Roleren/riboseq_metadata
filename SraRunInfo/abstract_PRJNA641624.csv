abstract
"We used Ribo-seq to determine how PRMT inhibition affects translation of different mRNAs, This analysis can generate a “snapshot” of all mRNAs that are occupied by active ribosomes (i.e., undergoing active translation) in a cell at a particular condition. Overall design: Ribo-seq was used to measure the distribution of ribosome protected RNA fragments in control and PRMT inhibition samples."
