"WDR12 is a ribosome biogenesis factor known to be expressed in Optic tectum Neuroepithelial cells, we define the transcriptome profile of the optic tectum neuroepithelial cells, by cell-sorting followed by RNA-seq (Illumina technology). Overall design: Using a Neuroepithelial cells driven medaka line expressing GFP under the control of the wdr12 promoter,( a ribosome biogenesis factor known to be expressed in Optic tectum  Neuroepithelial cells, we define the transcriptome profile of the optic tectum neuroepithelial cells, by cell-sorting followed by RNA-seq(Illumina technology) of wdr12:GFP+ and wdr12:GFP- tectal cells . The wdr12:GFP- cell population is a mix of several cell types (transitory-amplifying progenitors, post-mitotic neurons and glial cells). We used, as an additional control, the ebf3:GFP line (Mongin et al., 2011), in which post-mitotic progenitors and differentiated neurons of OT are GFP-positive in one month-old medakas."
