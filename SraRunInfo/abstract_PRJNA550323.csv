abstract
"In order to deal with their huge volume and complex morphology, neurons localize mRNAs and ribosomes near synapses to produce proteins locally. A relative paucity of polyribosomes (considered the active sites of translation) detected in electron micrographs of neuronal processes (axons and dendrites), however, has suggested a rather limited capacity for local protein synthesis. Polysome profiling together with ribosome footprinting of microdissected synaptic regions revealed that a surprisingly high number of dendritic and/or axonal transcripts were predominantly associated with monosomes (single ribosomes). Contrary to prevailing views, the neuronal monosomes were in the process of active protein synthesis (e.g. they exhibited elongation). Most mRNAs showed a similar translational status in both compartments, but some transcripts exhibited differential ribosome occupancy in the somata and neuropil. Strikingly, monosome-preferred transcripts often encoded high-abundance synaptic proteins. This work suggests a significant contribution of monosome translation to the maintenance of the local neuronal proteome. This mode of translation can presumably solve some of restricted space issues (given the large size of polysomes) and also increase the diversity of proteins made from a limited number of ribosomes available in dendrites and axons."
