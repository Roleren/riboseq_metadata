abstract
We performed ribosome profiling which is the deep-sequencing of mRNA fragments protected by translating ribosome for two Streptomyces species through different growth phases to provide the translatome data Overall design: Ribosome profiling data of Streptomyces griseus NBRC13350 and Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC15439 at four different growth phases in duplicates using Illumina HiSeq
