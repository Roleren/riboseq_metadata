abstract
"In this dataset, we included sequencing data of total and ribosome protected fragments obtained from PATU-8902 cell lines grown in DMEM (2.78mM glucose, 4mM glutamine, 1mM pyruvate) + 10%dialyzed FBS + 1% Pen/Strep with or without 400uM Ser and 400uM Gly for 24 hours. Overall design: Ribosome profiling was performed in PATU-8902 cells grown with or without serine and glycine for 24hours."
