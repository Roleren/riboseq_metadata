abstract
"We obtained the high-quality genome sequence of S. clavuligerus ATCC 27064, and determined genome-wide TSSs. Then, RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling were additionally exploited to reveal fundamental regulatory elements for transcription and translation. Overall design: Transcriptome (RNA-seq), translatome (ribosome profiling), primary transcriptome (dRNA-seq, pooled) data of Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 at four different growth phases in duplicates using Illumina HiSeq"
