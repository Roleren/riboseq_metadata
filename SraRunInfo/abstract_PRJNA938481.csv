abstract
"Oxidative stress causes K63-linked ubiquitination of ribosomes by the E2 ubiquitin conjugase, Rad6. How Rad6-mediated ubiquitination of ribosomes affects translation, however, is unclear. We therefore performed Ribo-seq and Disome-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and found that oxidative stress caused ribosome pausing at specific amino acid motifs, and this also led to ribosome collisions. However, these redox pausing signatures were lost in the absence of Rad6 but did not depend on the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway. We also found that Rad6 is needed to inhibit overall translation in response to oxidative stress and its deletion leads to increased expression of antioxidant genes. Finally, we observed that the lack of Rad6 leads to changes during translation initiation that affect activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Our results provide a high-resolution picture of the gene expression changes during oxidative stress and unravel an additional stress response pathway affecting translation elongation. Overall design: Gene expression and ribosome pausing analysis of wild-type cells or cells with mutants of HEL2 or RAD6  -/+  hydrogen peroxide by using Ribo-seq, Disome-seq and RNA-seq. Biological replicates are indicated when available. Strain backgrounds SUB280 and S288C are utilized."
