abstract
Our study found that insertion of commonly used selection cassettes in yeast can drive aberrant transcription events and disrupt expression of neighboring genes. We performed ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq on yeast strains where ORFs had been replaced with common selection cassettes and observed aberrant transcripts. Aberrant transcripts positioned near adjacent genomic loci repressed protein synthesis of those genes by transcription interference (ablating normal length transcript production) coincident with translation of competitive uORFs on the long transcript which prevented translation of the main ORF seen by ribosome profiling. Overall design: We performed ribosome profiling and matched mRNA-seq on wild-type and dbp1?::KANMX6 yeast of interest and observed the expression of loci near deleted ORFs
