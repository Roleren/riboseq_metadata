"We isolated ex vivo resting state B and T lymphocytes from B6 mouse spleen using magnetic separation (Miltenyi). After 2 hours of rest in RPMI mediaum, these cells were either used to isolate total RNA for RNAseq library preparation or treated with cycloheximide and proceeded with RNase digestion and library preparation for ribosome profiling (Riboseq). Overall design: RNAseq and Riboseq for resting state total B and T cells."
