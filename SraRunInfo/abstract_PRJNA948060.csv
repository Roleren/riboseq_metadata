abstract
"To further clarify the role of FPB1 and PAM68 in psbB mRNA translation and concomitant CP47 integration, ribosome profiling was performed. In addition, RNA-Seq analyses of the samples used for Ribo-Seq were performed showing that the abundance of the chloroplast mRNAs of the PSII subunits in the mutants is comparable with WT or slightly lower."
