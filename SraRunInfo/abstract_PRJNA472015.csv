abstract
Cellular stress is often accompanied by non-canonical initiation of translation at alternate start codons in mammalian cells. Here we systematically investigate the extent and impact of alternate translation initiation in the context of influenza virus infection. We use ribosome profiling with the initiation inhibitor lactidomycin to experimentally delineate translation initiation sites in a human lung epithelial cell line infected with influenza virus. Overall design: We use genome-wide methods (Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq) to examine how translation initiation is altered in influenza virus infected lung-epithelial cells
