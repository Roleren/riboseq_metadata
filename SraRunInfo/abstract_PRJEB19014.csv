abstract
"Hfq is a transcriptional and translational pleiotropic regulator in several bacteria. RNA-Seq, Ribo-Seq and Proteomic analyses were carried out in the wild-type and a hfq deletion strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 with the intention to separate the influence of Hfq on the transcript stability and translation. This submission relates to the Ribosome profiling data only. Ribosomes were purified from MNase treated cell lysates by density gradient ultracentrifugation from two replicate cultures each of SBW25-WT and SBW25-?hfq strains. RNA was extracted from the purified ribosomes and subjected to RNA-Seq in an Illumina HiSeq2000 machine. The resulting sequence data was analysed by mapping to the reference sequence of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 as available in the Genbank accession NC_012660."
