abstract
We present a ribosome profiling data set from S. cerevisiae as part of a larger study that models the elongation rate along transcripts as a function of local sequence neighborhoods. We then apply this model to design coding sequences that are optimized for translational output. Overall design: Two lanes of sequencing from one ribosome profiling experiment
