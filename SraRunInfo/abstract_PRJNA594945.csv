abstract
"RNG140 is an RNA-binding protein that increases in expression during eye lens differentiation and is involved in lens formation. However, the relevance of RNG140-mediated translational regulation to differentiation is not well understood. RNG140-mediated translational regulation operates in the mouse eye, where RNG140 knockout increased the translation of long mRNAs. mRNAs involved in lens differentiation, such as crystallin mRNAs, are short, and can escape translational inhibition by RNG140 and be translated in differentiating lenses. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq in the eye from P0.5 RNG140 knockout mice and control mice"
