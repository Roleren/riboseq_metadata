"We report ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq data of liver and kidney samples taken from C57BL/6 mice of different ages Overall design: Ribosome profiling and transcriptome sequencing of liver and kidney samples of C57BL/6 mice of different ages. Liver samples were collected from mice of six (1, 3, 11, 20, 26 and 32 months) different ages, whereas kidney samples were collected from the same mice of three (3, 20 and 32 months) ages. Samples from three animals were taken for each age, except for 32 months old mice (2 animals)."
