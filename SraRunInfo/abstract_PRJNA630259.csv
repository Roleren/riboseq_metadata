"Protein synthesis is essential for cilium assembly, but little is known about translational reprogramming that occurs during ciliogenesis. Using ribosome footprinting, we perform global translatome profiling on Chlamydomonas during flagellar regeneration. Overall design: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (strain CC-125) that were grown for 15, 30, 60, and 90 min after deflagellation to generate libraries for ribosome footprint sequencing (Ribo-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) . A reference sample was collected from the same culture before deflagellation (Non-Treated). We also performed RNA sequencing for C.elegans mutants : sptl-1/sptl-2/sptl-3. Each strain was analyzed in biological duplicate."
