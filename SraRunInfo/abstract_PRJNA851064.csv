abstract
"Ribosome profiling was applied for the first time on S. meliloti to generate a translatome map. Our work reveals active translation for several ORFs including small ORFs (sORFs). In addition, our ribosome profiling data led to the discovery of several translated non-annotated sORFs. Translation of these non-annotated sORFs was validated by proteomics and western blotting. Overall design: 2 replicates of Total RNA-seq and two replicates of Ribo-seq of S. meliloti"
