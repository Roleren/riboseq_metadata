abstract
"We present ribosome profiling(for activaly translated RNA) and RNA-seq (for total RNA) data for human corneal epithelial cells exposed to mild osmotic stress (500 mOsm) for 1h and 6h (additionally torin1 (mTOR inhibitor) or MeAIB (SNAT2 inhibitor were added for the last hour of treatment. Overall design: Ribosomal profiling and RNA-seq of human corneal epithelial cells. There are 4 replicates for each of the following conditions: control, 1h exposure to 500 mOsm, 6h exposure to 500 mOsm, 6h exposure to 500 mOsm + Torin1 for the last hour of treatment, 6h exposure to 500 mOsm + MeAIB for the last hour of treatment"
