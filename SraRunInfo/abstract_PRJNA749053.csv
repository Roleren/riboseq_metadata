abstract
"We describe the subset of transcripts that require DDX3 for efficient translation and identify similarities and differences between X- and Y- linked paralogs of DDX3. Overall design: Ribosome profiling upon auxin-induced degradation of DDX3X, and covered with either DDX3X or DDX3Y was performed from HCT116 cells."
