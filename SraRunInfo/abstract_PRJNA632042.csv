abstract
"Mitochondria are organelles that generate most of the energy in eukaryotic cells in the form of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryote. Twenty-two species of mitochondrial (mt-)tRNAs encoded in mtDNA are required to translate essential subunits of the respiratory chain complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. mt-tRNAs contain post-transcriptional modifications introduced by nuclear-encoded tRNA-modifying enzymes. These modifications are required for deciphering genetic code accurately, as well as stabilizing tRNA. Loss of tRNA modifications frequently results in severe pathological consequences. We performed a comprehensive analysis of post-transcriptional modifications of all human mt-tRNAs, including 14 previously-uncharacterized species, and revised the modification status of some of the previously studied species. In total, we found 17 kinds of RNA modifications at 137 positions (8.7% in 1,575 nucleobases) in 22 species of human mt-tRNAs. An up-to-date list of 34 genes responsible for human mt-tRNA modifications are provided. We here demonstrated that both QTRT1 and QTRT2 are required for biogenesis of queuosine (Q) at position 34 of four mt-tRNAs. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the mitochondrial decoding system, and could help to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of human mitochondrial diseases caused by aberrant tRNA modifications.
