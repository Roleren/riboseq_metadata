abstract
"We performed transcriptional profiling of cells treated with different cell penetrating peptides for different timepoints to see the effect of each peptide on cell biology and pathways which are affected by it. In conclusion, CPPs evoke similar response, regardless of the CPP structure or chemistry, mostly afecting genes related to ribosome biogenesis, microtubule dynamics and expression of long non-coding RNAs Overall design: RNA seq of HeLa cells treated with different cell penetrating peptides for different time points. 2 replicates for each group"
