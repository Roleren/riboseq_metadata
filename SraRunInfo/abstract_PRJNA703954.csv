"Using a transcriptome-wide profiling approach to map translation initiation start sites in human beta-cells under standard and inflammatory conditions, we identifies non-canonical start sites and translation initiation within lncRNA. Overall design: EndoC-BH1 cells have been treated 24h with proinflammatory cytokines 1000 U/ml IFN? and 2 ng/ml IL1ÃŸ for 24 h. RNA was isolated by TRizol and sequenced by nanopore sequencing to etablish the de novo transcritpome. Upon incubation, cells were treated with 2ug/ml harringtonine for 30 minutes and Cycloheximide (100ug/ml) for ribosome footprint purification."
