"Eukaryotic ribosomal RNA carries diverse posttranscriptional modifications, the function of which are mostly unexplored. The evolutionarily conserved 2'-O-methylation (2'-O-Me) occurs at more than 100 sites and is essential for ribosome biogenesis. Plasticity of 2Â´-O-Me in ribosomes and its functional consequences in human disease remain to be elucidated. We performed RiboMethSeq to  estabolish the full rRNA 2'-O-Me landscape (ribomethylome) in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through profiling 94 patient samples as well as 21 normal hematopoietic samples of 5 different lineages.  The gene expression in the same samples was determined by RNA-Seq.  We found that higher 2'-O-methylation on exterior dynamic sites associated with leukemia stem cell (LSC) signatures. Overall design: 94 primary AMLs and 21 normal hematopoeitic cells of 5 different lineages was used for RiboMethSeq. The gene expression profiling in the same samples was determined by RNA-Seq. The association of rRNA 2'-O-Me pattern was confirmed with second independent AML cohort."
