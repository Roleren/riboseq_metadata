abstract
"To study the role of eIF5A-Hyp in murine B cells, ribosome profiling was performed in LPS-stimulated B cells treated with GC7 (an inhibitor of hypusination) or vehicle. Fragmented total mRNA was also sequenced as the control. Ribosome stalling and translation efficiency as well as overall transcriptomic changes can be assessed."
