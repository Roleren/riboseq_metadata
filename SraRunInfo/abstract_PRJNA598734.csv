abstract
"The biological impact of microRNAs is determined by their targets, and robustly identifying direct miRNA targets remains challenging. Existing methods suffer from high false-positive rates and are unable to effectively differentiate direct miRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes. Here, we present a simple approach to deconvolute post-transcriptional and transcriptional changes using PRO-seq with RNA-seq. In combination, these methods allow us to systematically profile the regulatory impact of a miRNA. We refer to this approach as CARP: Combined Analysis of RNA-seq and PRO-seq. We apply CARP to multiple miRNAs and show that it robustly distinguishes direct targets from downstream changes, while greatly reducing false positives. We validate our approach using Argonaute eCLIP-seq and ribosome profiling, demonstrating that CARP defines a comprehensive repertoire of targets. We identify miRNA-specific activity of target sites within the coding region. CARP facilitates the dissection of complex changes in gene regulatory networks triggered by miRNAs and identification of transcription factors that underlie downstream regulatory changes. Given the robustness of the approach, CARP is particularly suitable for dissecting miRNA regulatory networks in vivo. Overall design: Gene expression profiling of HEK293 cells with and without specific miRNAs by high-throughput sequencing, in duplicate or triplicate, using Illumina NextSeq500."
