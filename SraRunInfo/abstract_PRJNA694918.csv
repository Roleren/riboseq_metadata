"The tRNA pool determines the efficiency, throughput, and accuracy of translation. Previous studies have identified dynamic changes in the tRNA supply and mRNA demand during cancerous proliferation. Yet, dynamic changes may occur also during physiologically normal proliferation, and these are less characterized. We examined the tRNA and mRNA pools of T-cells during their vigorous proliferation and differentiation upon triggering of the T cell antigen receptor. We observe a global signature of switch in demand for codon at the early proliferation phase of the response, accompanied by corresponding changes in tRNA expression levels. In the later phase, upon differentiation of the T cells, the response of the tRNA pool is relaxed back to basal level, potentially restraining excessive proliferation. Sequencing of tRNAs allowed us to also evaluate their diverse base-modifications. We found that two types of tRNA modifications, Wybutosine and ms2t6A, are reduced dramatically during T-cell activation. These modifications occur in the anti-codon loops of two tRNAs that decode “slippery codons”, that are prone to ribosomal frameshifting. Attenuation of these frameshift-protective modifications is expected to increase proteome-wide frameshifting during T-cell proliferation. Indeed, human cell lines deleted of a Wybutosine writer showed increased ribosomal frameshifting, as detected with a reporter that consists of a critical frameshifting site taken from the HIV gag-pol slippery codon motif. These results may explain HIV's specificity to proliferating T-Cells since it requires ribosomal frameshift exactly on this codon for infection. The changes in tRNA expression and modifications uncover a new layer of translation regulation during T-cell proliferation and exposes a potential trade-off between cellular growth and translation fidelity.
