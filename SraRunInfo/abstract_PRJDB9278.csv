"In this project, we analyzed function of Fbl in neural stem cells at different levels. First, we performed single cell analysis using cells from dorsal brains of Fbl mutant and control mice at different stages (E10, E11, E12, E13 and E14). Then, we performed ribosome profiling using E14 dorsal brains from control and mutant mice. Next, we performed H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) using isolated NSCs from Hes1-d2-EGFP reporter and cells from dorsal brains of E14 Fbl control and mutant mice. Finally, we treated cells from dorsal brains with inhibitors of methyltransferase and demethylase of H3K27me3 and tested how H3K27me3 changes affects fate of neural stem cells by RNA-seq."
