abstract
"Emerging evidence suggests that the cryptic translation beyond the annotated translatome may yield proteins with important function. However, the role and function mechanism of these cryptic ORFs in complex diseases such as cancer remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, we combined  ribosome profiling and CRISPR/Cas9 screen to systematically identify the colorectal cancer (CRC) dependency on cryptic ORFs. Overall design: CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen and ribosome profiling to systematically discover nocanonical open reading frame encoded in long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and explored their critical roles in colorectal cancer progression. RNA-Seq analysis the differernt expressed genes after SMMIP kockout or SMC1A knockdown. ChIP-Seq analysis SMC1A binding sites on genome."
