abstract
"To analyze the regulation of skeletal muscle development. And explore the function of coding products of non coding RNA in skeletal muscle. LncRNAs and circRNAs of bovine skeletal muscle were identified by transcriptome analysis to predict potential ORFs. Combined with ribosomal translation fragments, ORFs and their source ncRNAs were screened and identified."
