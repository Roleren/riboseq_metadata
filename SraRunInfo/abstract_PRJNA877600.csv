abstract
RNA sequencing libraries of ribosome containing granules of MCF-7 cells that were pelleted by 136.000 x g through a 60% sucrose cushion in the presence or in the absence of 25 mM final EDTA. In the presence of EDTA polysomes are destroyed and only ribosomes that are inside granules can sediment through the cushion.
