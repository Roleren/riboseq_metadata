"Objective To study the effect of high concentration of glucose on the transcriptome expression profile of islet bata cell line in type 1 diabetes (T1D) mice and to explore the possible mechanism of high glucose environmental factors in the pathogenesis of T1D. Methods The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice-derived islet bata cell line NIT-1 cells in logarithmic growth phase were divided into high glucose-treated (HG) and control (NIT1) group.The cells in NIT1 group were routinely cultured in F-12K medium, while HG group were treated with high concentration of 20mM glucose. Whole whole-transcriptome profiling was analyzed using RNA-sequencing technology to obtain the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). and the DEGs were further analyzed by GO annotation and KEGG Pathway enrichment analysis. Results A total of 5548 DEGs were detected between NIT1 group and HG group. Among them, 2701 DEGs were upregulated in HG group, which were significantly enriched in endoplasmic reticulum stress, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, insulin signal regulation pathway, ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, autophagy, apoptosis, antigen processing and presentation pathways.And 2847 down-regulated genes are mainly concentrated in ribosome, metabolism, biosynthesis, cell cycle, DNA replication and biological processes such as DNA damage repair, translation, cell division and RNA processing Moreover, mRNA expression levels of important T1D autoantigens, such as Insulin and Chromogranin A, were significantly increased in the HG group. Conclusion The expression of autoantigen-related genes in islet bata-cell lines changed significantly under high glucose environment, and the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress, protein degradation, processing presentation and autophagy pathway-related genes were also up-regulated. It is suggested that high glucose stimulation changes the expression of islet bata-cell line transcriptional group, and these changes may be related to the occurrence and development of T1D."
