abstract
"Using ribosome profiling and RNA-Sequencing, we reveal that eIF5A2 is functionally distinct from eIF5A1 and does not regulate transcript-specific or global protein synthesis. Instead, eIF5A2 knockout leads to decreased intrinsic antiviral gene expression. Overall design: SW480 cells were grown in complete media for a day before harvesting."
