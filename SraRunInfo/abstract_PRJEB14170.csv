abstract
Arabidopsis wild-type and catalase2 knock-out mutants were subjected to 3 hrs of high light intensities. Middle aged leaves were sampled and both mRNA-seq and ribo-seq data was generated before the onset of oxidative stress treatment and after 3 hrs of high light. This describes the ribo-seq data.
