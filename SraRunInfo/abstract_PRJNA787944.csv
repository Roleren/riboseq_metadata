abstract
"Hypusinated EiF5A likely impacts diverse cellular pathways, through direct regulation of its translational targets or via secondary effects on other biological processes. We examined the global effects of knockdown of EiF5A and Dhps on the transcriptome and translational landscape of MYC-induced lymphoma. Overall design: To evaluate the effects of EiF5A or Dhps depletion on transcription and translation, RNA-seq analyses of Em-Myc;Rosa26 -rtTA2 lymphoma cells that inducibly express sh-Ren, sh-EiF5A or sh-Dhps were performed along with ribosome profiling."
