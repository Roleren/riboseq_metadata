"Variable rRNA 2'-O-me contributes to ribosome heterogeneity. We show that the rRNA 2'-O-me profile is dynamic in a tissue-specific manner during the directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). 2'-O-me at position 26S:3904 transiently decreases at the neural progenitor (NPC) stage during neurogenesis. Knock-out of SNORD52, the guide of 28S:3904 2'-O-me, results in hESCs shifting to a NPC identity. We report that the lack of 28S:3904 methylation leads to an increased binding to the FMRP protein and translation of WNT pathway members. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of H9 and H9SNORD52 knockout cells. H9 cells have rRNA 28S:Um3904 methylation whereas H9SNORD52 knockout cells do not have 28S:Um3904 methylation."
