abstract
"p16/CDKN2A is a critical cell cycle regulator and tumor suppressor that is lost in ~50% of all human cancers. Recent studies have identified roles of p16 outside of the cell cycle. Understanding the fundamental biology of p16 loss in cancer may provide novel targets to exploit for therapy. Overall design: To investigate the transcriptonal and translational differences upon p16 loss, we knocked down p16 in SKMEL28 human melanoma cell lines. We isolated total mRNA and fractionated light (0-2) and heavy (>2) ribosome fractions. All samples were done in triplicate. Comparative gene expression profiling analysis for SKMEL28 shGFP (control) and shp16."
