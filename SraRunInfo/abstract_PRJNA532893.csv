abstract
"We performed rigorous ribosome profiling in genome-edited cell lines with human MTOR point mutations and Torin1 treated cell lines. By obtaining about 10 million bases of sequence cells, we generated genome-wide translatome and transcriptome data of genome-edited MTOR(G4448A)-p.C1483Y and Torin1 treated cell lines Overall design: Examination of transcriptome and translatome in 3 cell types."
