abstract
"To investigate the effect of METTL3 function in the regulation of neutrophil activation,  we established neutrophil METTL3 knock out mice by crossing METTL3flox/flox mice with Lyzm-cre mice. We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from Ribosome-seq of isolated neutrophil from METTL3f/f and METTL3f/f Lyzm-Cre mice . Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of Ribosome-seq data and RNA-seq data for METTL3flox/flox neutrophil and METTL3flox/flox-Lyzmcre neutrophil."
