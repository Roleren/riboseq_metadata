abstract
eIF2B5 is necessary for HrasG12V hyperplastic growth.  Ribosome profiling was used to describe HrasG12V and WT dependence on eIF2B5-mediated translation. Overall design: E9.5 HrasG12V and WT mouse epidermis was transduced by in utero injection with shScrambled control or shEif2b5. E18.5 epidermal basal cells were enriched for ribosome profiling and RNAseq.
