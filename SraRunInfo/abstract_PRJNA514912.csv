abstract
"Injury to the proximal tubule plays a central role in the initiation and progression of kidney fibrosis, and rates of chronic kidney disease progresses approximately 50% faster in males compared to females. We applied Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) followed by RNA-sequencing to characterize the cell-specific proximal tubule transcriptional landscape during fibrosis in male vs. female mice. Overall design: Promixal tubule was profiled by Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP)"
