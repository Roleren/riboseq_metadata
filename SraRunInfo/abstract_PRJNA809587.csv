abstract
"Translational regulation plays a critical role during oocyte-to-embryo transition including zygotic genome activation. However, the translatome during OET and molecular mechanisms underlying human ZGA remain largely uncharted. Here, we integrated ultra-low-input Ribo-seq with RNA-seq (R2-lite) to jointly profile the translatome and transcriptome from the same samples across 8 stages in human oocytes and early embryos. These data not only unveil conservation and divergence of the translation landscapes between human and mouse OET, but also identify critical regulators of human ZGA. Overall design: Ultra-low-input Ribo-seq(Ribo-lite) with RNA-seq (R2-lite) was performed on human oocytes and early embryos. RNA-seq was performed on human embryos with knockdown of transcription factors or under drug treatment.  RNA-seq and Stacc-seq were performed on hESC overexpressing transcription factors."
