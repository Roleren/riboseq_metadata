abstract
"Translation elongation in Arabidopsis thaliana was studied using ribosome profiling. 3 biological replicates of young, immature leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, Col-0, grown in short day conditions for 7 weeks were harvested. Ribosomal footprints were produced by digestion with MNase, the ribosomes were purified by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and the RNA was isolated from the ribosome fraction. The 16-42 nt fraction was sequenced using Illumina's HiSeq 4000."
