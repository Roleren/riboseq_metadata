abstract
"The acute stress response mobilizes energy to meet situational demands and re-establish homeostasis. Here, we used a brief forced swim exposure to trigger a strong stress response in mice. Using multiomic profiling we characterize the stress-induced molecular events in the dorsal (dHC) and ventral (vHC) hippocampus over time, across molecular scales, and down to the level of cell types and single cells. Overall design: Examining the effect of acute swim stress (6min at 18Â°C) on the transcriptome and translatome of the mouse hippocampus at multiple time-points (all data: Stressome_GeneCounts.txt). This series contains data from multiple experiments investigating this. Following sub-experiments were conducted: TimeSeriesFST (TimeSeriesFST_GeneCounts.txt): Experiment to assess stress induced transcriptional changes in the hippocampus at multiple time points (45min, 1h30min, 2h, 3h, 4h) vs controls in the dorsal (dHC) and ventral hippocampus (vHC). FSTFemale45min4h (SwimFemale45min4h_GeneCounts.txt): Experiment replicating two time points (45min and 4h) from the time-series with female and male mice to investigate sex effects in the vHC. LeftvsRight (LeftvsRight_GeneCounts.txt): Experiment to assess differences in the acutes stress response (45min) between left and right hemisphere in both dHC and vHC. CMVTRAP (CMVTRAP_GeneCounts.txt): Experiment to assess changes in ribosome occupancy (active translation) in a ubiquitous TRAP assay (all cell types) at 45minutes in the vHC in both pre- and post-IP fractions. CAMK2A-TRAP (CAMK2A-TRAP_GeneCounts.txt)/CAMK2A-TRAP-2 (CAMK2A-TRAP_Exp2_GeneCounts.txt): Two experiments to assess translation changes in excitatory neurons after acute stress in the dHC and vHC at 45min and 1h30min. VIAAT-TRAP (VIAAT-TRAP_GeneCounts.txt): Experiment to assess translation changes in inhibitory neurons after acute stress in the dHC and vHC at 45min"
