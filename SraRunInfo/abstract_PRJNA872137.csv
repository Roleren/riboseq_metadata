"The?eIF4E family of translation initiation factors bind 5' methylated caps and act as the limiting-step for mRNA translation. The canonical eIF4E1A is required for cell viability, yet other related families exist and are all utilized in specific contexts or tissues. Here, we describe a new family called Eif4e1c that is ancestral to the canonical eIF4E1A in vertebrates, and for which we find roles during heart development and regeneration in zebrafish.?The Eif4e1c family is present in all aquatic vertebrates but has been lost in all terrestrial species. A core group of amino acids shared over 500 million years of evolution from?ray-finned fish to sharks?forms an evolutionarily conserved binding interface along the surface of the protein, suggesting Eif4e1c functions in a novel pathway.? Deletion of eif4e1c?in zebrafish caused growth deficits and impaired survival in juveniles.?Mutants surviving to adulthood had fewer cardiomyocytes, while also showing reduced proliferative responses to cardiac injury. Ribosome profiling of mutant hearts demonstrated changes in translation efficiency of mRNA for genes known to regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation. Although?eif4e1c?is expressed in many tissues and is the predominant cap-binding initiation homolog in embryos, its disruption had most notable impact on the heart and at juvenile stages. ?Our findings reveal context-dependent requirements for translation initiation regulators during heart regeneration. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of adult uninjured eif4e1c zebrafish mutant hearts and adult uninjured EK zebrafish (wildtype) hearts."
