abstract
"We report the presence of extensive, transcriptionally controlled oscillations in the C. elegans, developmental transcriptome. Furthermore, using ribosome profiling, we show that these oscillating transcripts are actively translated. Overall design: Ribosome-profiling analysis of a timecourse that was collected over C. elegans development"
