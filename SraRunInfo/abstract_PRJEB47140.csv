abstract
"We report the application of ribosome profiling followed by next-generation sequencing of human undifferentiated adipose-derived stem cells (hASC). Cells are isolated from the adipose tissue of three female donors after liposuction procedure, expanded and characterized. These data allow an analysis of the ribosome-protected fragments and the translational dynamics in different RNAs."
