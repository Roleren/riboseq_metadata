abstract
"Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) serves as a standard chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, while the drug resistance is still a considerable challenge. Dysregulation of lncRNA is involved in cancer and recent translatomics has found some alleged lncRNA actually contained small open reading frames and could encode short peptides. This ribosome footprint profiling (Ribo-seq) was a paired-end sequencing and aimed to investigate whether lncRNA could regulate oxaliplatin resistance in colorectal cancer by encoding short peptides."
