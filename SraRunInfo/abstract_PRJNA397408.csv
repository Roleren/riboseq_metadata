"We performed ribosome profiling of polysomes (Poly-RIBOseq) to monitor translation of  RNAs associated with polysomes in brain extracts from a mouse model Keywords: ribosome profiling, translation, polysome profiling, Poly-RIBOseq Overall design: We extracted polysomal  fractions from brains of a mouse model (Smn+/-; SMN2tg/0) and performed ribosome profiling (Poly-RIBOseq). Experiments were performed in biological duplicate."
