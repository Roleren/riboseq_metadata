abstract
"We employ CLIP-Seq, RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq in cultured neurons expressing R495X or wild-type FUS to identify effects of the mutation on the FUS targetome and on the neuronal transcriptome at the expression and translation level Overall design: We set up an inducible expression system based on lentiviral transduction of FLAG-tagged human R495X or wild-type FUS in neurons differentiated from mouse Embryonic Stem cells. we performed CLIP-Seq , RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq in neurons expressing WT or R495X."
