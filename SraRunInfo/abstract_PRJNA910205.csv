abstract
"Degradation of most yeast mRNAs involves decapping by Dcp1/Dcp2. DEAD-box protein Dhh1 has been implicated as an activator of decapping, and as a translational repressor, but their functions in cells are incompletely understood. We have analyzed these questions by a combination of ribosome profiling, RNA-Seq, CAGE analysis of capped mRNAs. Overall design: It includes total 14 samples. pat1, pat1dhh1 (triplicates) and edc3scd6 (duplicates) were subjected to RNA-Seq. Separately, WT and dcp2 in triplicates (6 samples) were subjected to Rpb1 ChIP-seq. All strains were grown in YPD at 30ÂºC till the OD600 ~0.6"
