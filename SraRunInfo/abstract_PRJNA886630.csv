"mTOR pathway is a major regulator of translation in eukaryotic cells. Here we investigate the impact of mTOR overactivation through TSC2 KO on the translatome of brain organoid tissue. Overall design: Day37 organoids were dissociated and the lysate was used for polysome profiling. Monosome, low-polysome and high-polysome fractions were separately collected and the RNA associated with these fractions was isolated and used for RNA-seq"
