"The proline-rich antimicrobial peptide apidaecin (Api) inhibits bacterial protein synthesis in a distinctive way. In vitro biochemical and structural studies showed that Api binds in the nascent peptide exit tunnel of a ribosome that has completed translation of a gene and traps the release factors on the ribosome. By analyzing the distribution of ribosomes on mRNAs in Api-treated cells using Ribo-seq, we uncovered a range of effects that stem from the unique mechanism of Api action. Exposure of bacterial cells to Api results in arrest of ribosomes at stop codons, likely in a post-release state due to direct Api action, as well as in a pre-release state due to the depletion of available release factors. In addition, Api action leads to a pronounced queuing of translating ribosomes behind those arrested at stop codons. One of the major consequences of Api action is a dramatically increased level of stop codon bypass by ribosomes paused in a pre-release state, leading to an accumulation of proteins with C-terminal extensions, as confirmed by whole-cell proteomics analysis. Stop codon bypass occurs either in 0-frame, by misincorporation of a near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA at the stop codon, or via frameshifting, allowing for a fraction of the translating ribosomes to reach the 3' ends of mRNA transcripts. The pervasive stalling of pre-release ribosomes at the stop codons and at the RNA transcripts ends triggers activation of the cellular ribosome rescue systems which, likely due to Api action as well, remain ineffective. Understanding the unique mode of Api action as translation termination inhibitor in the cell can advance the development of treatments for infection and genetic diseases as well as new research tools for genome exploration. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq were performed on Escherichia coli dosed with apidaecin and compared to non-treated cells (2 biological replicates each). Additionally, the lysate of one Api replicate and one control replicate were treated with the antibiotic puromycin in an attempt to clear ribosomes from the mRNAs."
