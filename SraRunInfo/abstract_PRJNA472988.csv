abstract
"We have identified mRNAs whose abundance or translational efficiency is regulated in nutrient-rich medium by the Scd6 or Dhh1 protein in either wild-type cells or dcp2? cells lacking the decapping enzyme Overall design: Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq was conducted to determine changes in mRNA abundance, translation, or translational efficiecies in comparing scd6? or dhh1? mutants to an isogenic wild-type strain; or scd6?dcp2? and dhh1?dcp2? strains to a dcp2? mutant"
