abstract
The Ribo-seq analysis demonstrated that eIF1A is predominantly essential for translation of genes with long 5'UTR genes including cell proliferation and cell cycle progression genes. eIF1A depletion causes broad stimulation of initiation in 5'UTRs at near-cognate AUG codons that diminshes the translation initiation fidelity Overall design: Ribo-seq analysis was performed either in contol or eIF1A knockdown MEFs
