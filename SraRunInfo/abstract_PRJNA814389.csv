abstract
"Using acRIP-seq, we present transcriptome-wide atlases of ac4C in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. Analysis of ac4C distribution reveals ac4C is enriched near translation start sites in rice while near translation start sites and end sites in Arabidopsis. Further analysis shows ac4C contributes to RNA stability, splicing and translation. We then performed NaCNBH3 treatment and RNA-seq to measure C to T mutation and RNC-seq to measure translation efficiency in Arabidopsis. Overall design: This series includes samples for ac4C-seq: control and treated samples from Arabidopsis and rice, samples for acRIP-seq: two biological replicates for ac4C IP, IgG control and input samples and samples for RNC-seq: Input (mRNA) and Ribosome associated (RNC-mRNA) samples from Arabidopsis, Input (mRNA) and Ribosome associated (RNC-mRNA) samples from wild type rice and osnat10."
