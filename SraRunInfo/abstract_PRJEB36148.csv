abstract
"Murine 17Cl-1 cells were infected with the model Betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 and subjected to ribosome profiling to observe changes in the host translatome in infected cells compared to mock-infected cells. Samples were harvested at 5 and 8 hpi by flash-freezing, without cycloheximide pre-treatment. RNase I treatment was carried out, following which ribosomes and enclosed RNA were isolated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. RNA was extracted, ribosomal RNA was removed using Illumina's RiboZero kit, and remaining RNA was gel purified to select fragments 25-35nt long. Fragments were cloned into adapters using the TruSeq small RNA adapter kit and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq, then differential translation efficiency analysis was carried out on the data deposited data. One uninfected sample was treated with 2ug/mL tunicamycin for 6 hours before harvesting as a positive control for unfolded protein response activation."
