"We performed targeted purification of polysomal mRNA (TRAP-Seq, Vragovic et al, 2015 - http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1417947112) using a transgenic line ubiquitously expressing a GFP-tagged RPL18 (Mustroph et al, 2009 - https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0906131106) 6h after the synchronous induction of lateral root formation by auxin treatment (IAA) upon inhibition of TOR activity (AZD8055 treatment, AZD). To correct for abundance of mRNA, bulk RNA-Seq was performed on the same samples and used to normalise the reads purified with the ribosomes. Overall design: Samples were prepared as described in  (Thellmann et al, 2020 - https://dx.doi.org/10.3791/60919). Samples ubiquitously expressing a GFP-tagged RPL18 ribosomal protein (p35S:HF-GFP-RPL18, N69096, (Mustroph et al, 2009 - https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0906131106)) were pretreated at 7 DAG for 16h either with 10 µM AZD8055 or DMSO control media before being transferred to DMSO, 10 µM IAA, 10 µM AZD8055 or 10 µM AZD8055 + 10 µM IAA. Root tissues were then dissected after 6h. All sampling were performed in triplicate."
