"We perform Ribosome Profiling (Riboseq) analysis of mouse Neuro2a neuronal cultures in Ebp1-siRNA knockdown vs. scrambled-siRNA control conditions in biological triplicate to assess the translation-specific function of Ebp1 Overall design: Each biological triplicate analyzed for both ribosome-protected mRNA fragments after RNAse digestion (Riboseq), and total steady-state mRNA (RNASeq), followed by high-throughput sequencing."
