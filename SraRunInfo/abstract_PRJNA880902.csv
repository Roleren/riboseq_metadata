"To investigate ribosome localization and gene expression dynamics during starvation in cancer cells, we performed RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling in RKO cells under fed and starved (12.5 uM arginine) conditions. Overall design: Cells were kept under fed (400 uM arginine) or starved (12.5 uM arginine) conditions for 24 hours. RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling were performed concurrently following previously published protocols (PMID 28579404)"
