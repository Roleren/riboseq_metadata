abstract
"Ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing from mid-log phase Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains PAO1 and ATCC 33988 grown on either glycerol or n-alkanes. Multiple strains of the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginos can survive on normal alkanes as a sole carbon source. The environmental P. aeruginosa strain ATCC 33988, isolated from a fuel storage tank, consumes n-alkanes much more efficiently than the clinical lab isolate PAO1. We combine multiple â€“omics techniques to elucidate gene expression pattern differences between these two closely-related P. aeruginosa strains."
