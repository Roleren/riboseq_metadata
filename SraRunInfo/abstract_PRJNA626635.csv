abstract
"We report that 2'-O-methylation levels at subset of positions in human ribosomal RNA are variable between cell types and conditions, and that the degree of methylation at distinct sites is responsive to key cellular pathways. MYC overexpression results in increased methylation at a particular rRNA site (18S:C174). We find that this methylation is important for modulating translation of distinct mRNAs, leading to phenotypic changes including modulation of cell proliferation rate. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of HelaS3 and HelaS3-SNORD45C knockout cells. HelaS3 cells have rRNA 18S:Cm174 methylation whereas HelaS3-SNORD45C knockout cells cells do not have 18S:Cm174 methylation. Please note that each processed data was generated from all replicates and is linked to the corresponding *_1 sample records."
