abstract
"To date, translational regulation of key genes controlling infection-related processes in fungal pathogens during their interactions with plants has not been studied. Here, we employed ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) to study translational responses and how such responses are coordinated with transcriptional changes in the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum (Fg), which causes Fusarium head blight (FHB), a destructive disease of cereal crops worldwide. This has revealed that transcription and translation were not always coordinated with approximately 22% of Fg genes showing a discordant relationship during wheat infection. Nitrite reductase, which we show here as an important component of fungal virulence, is only regulated at the translational level in Fg. In addition, more than 1000 new open reading frames (ORFs), many of which are short and highly conserved, were identified in the Fg genome. Like in higher eukaryotes, translation is controlled by upstream ORFs (uORFs) in Fg during infection. Similarly, miRNAs control both transcription and translation in Fg during wheat infection."
