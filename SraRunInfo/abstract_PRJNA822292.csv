abstract
"These data include RNA-seq, circRNA-seq, and small RNA-seq of transcriptome, Ribo-seq of translatome and protein protein binary interactions by recombination-based library vs. library yeast-2-hybrid throughout the lifecycle of the maize inbred line B73. Overall design: We constructed a integrative network map involving co-expression, co-translation and interactome network."
