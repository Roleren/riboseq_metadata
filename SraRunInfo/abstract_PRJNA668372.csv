"Cells can respond to stalled ribosomes by sensing ribosome collisions and employing quality control pathways. How ribosome stalling is resolved without collisions, however, has remained elusive. Here, focusing on non-colliding stalling exhibited by decoding-defective ribosomes, we identified Fap1 as a stalling sensor triggering 18S non-functional rRNA decay via poly-ubiquitination of uS3. Ribosome profiling revealed an enrichment of Fap1 at the translation initiation site but also association with elongating individual ribosomes. Cryo-EM structures of Fap1-bound ribosomes elucidated Fap1 probing the mRNA simultaneously at both the entry and exit channels suggesting a mRNA stasis sensing activity, and Fap1 sterically hinders formation of canonical collided di-ribosomes. Our findings indicate that individual stalled ribosomes are the potential signal for ribosome dysfunction, leading to accelerated turnover of the ribosome itself. Overall design: 20 ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) samples are included in the study. Ribo-seq samples were obtained from (1) total cell lysates (input) collected prior to purification, (2) MS2-purified ribosomes carrying exogenously encoded wild type or mutant rRNA, or (3) co-purified ribosomes from pull-downs of proteins of interest (Mag2, Fap1, or Yil161w). Input samples serve as controls that are compared against purified ribosomes. Each sample has a biological replicate."
