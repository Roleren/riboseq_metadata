abstract
"An increasing amount of studies integrate mRNA sequencing data into MS-based proteomics to complement the translation product search space. We present the generation of a protein synthesis-based database from deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. This approach increases the overall protein identification rates with 3% and 11% (improved and new identifications) for human and mouse respectively and enables proteome-wide detection of 5â€™-extended proteoforms, uORF translation and near-cognate translation start sites. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of lactimidomycin and cycloheximide treated HCT116 cells"
