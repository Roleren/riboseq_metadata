abstract
Acute response to combinatorial ribosome-targeting therapy in vivo is associated with downregulation of the cells' translational activity and energy metabolism. Translational alterations drive therapeutic resistance by promoting elevated metabolic activity and activation of a cAMP-dependent pro-survival mechanism via EPAC1/2. Overall design: Polysome profiling analysis of lymph node isolated from mice treated with CX-5461 and/or everolimus to investigate acute response(s) to ribosome-targeting therapy. Resistance mechanism to ribosome-targeting therapy was evaluated by polysome profiling of in vivo-derived early-passage cell lines isolated at ethical endpoint upon disease relapse.
