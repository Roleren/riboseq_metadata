abstract
"We developed RiboLace, a novel method based on a new puromycin-containing molecule, for the isolation of active ribosomes by means of an antibody-free and tag-free pull-down approach. RiboLace is fast, it works with very low input material and can be easily and rapidly used to enhance Ribo-Seq, obtaining  a global snapshot on active ribosome footprints at single nucleotide resolution from  eukaryotic in vitro and in vivo systems. Keywords: ribosome profiling, translation, RiboLace, Ribo-Seq, active translation Overall design: We performed active ribosome profiling with RiboLace in brain extracts from a mouse (Smn+/-; SMN2tg/0). Experiments were performed in biological duplicate."
