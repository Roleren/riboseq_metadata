abstract
"To knock down SLC3A2, MCF10A cells were either transfected with control siRNAs, or siRNAs specifically targetting SLC3A2. Samples were either untreated or treated with TGFb. Ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing was performed on these samples. MCF10A cells with and without SLC3A2 overexpression construct were either untreated or treated with TGFb. Ribosome profiling was performed on these samples. Overall design: 1 biological replicate of each condition."
