"We report the mapping of LIN28B binding to RNA in HEK293A at various LIN28B expression levels using enhanced CLIP. We provide small RNA sequencing data regarding miRNA expression in HEK293A and those miRNAs bound by AGO2. We also profile the effect of LIN28B expression on transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy in HEK293A via RNA-seq. Finally, we provide orthogonal regulatory data by profiling the effect of LIN28B expression on transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy in NIH3T3 via RNA-seq. Overall design: Examination of LIN28B binding using enhanced CLIP via 2 biological replicates of RNA fragments derived from LIN28B immunoprecipitation and 2 control input replicates for 5 LIN28B expression conditions. X0 is lin28b knockout. X1 through X4 are increasing levels of lin28b expression (X1 < X2 < X3 < X4). X1 through X4 lie within the naturally occurring spectrum of lin28b expression from other cell types such as HepG2, NTera2 and iPSC. Examination of small RNAs expressed in HEK293A and those specifically bound by AGO2, in the presence or absence of LIN28B or transfected let-7a miRNA, single replicate. Examination of changes in transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy in HEK293A via total RNA (2 replicates) and ribosome-bound RNA (2 replicates) for 5 different LIN28B expression conditions.  Experimental design for examining changes in transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy in NIH3T3 were the same as for HEK293A."
