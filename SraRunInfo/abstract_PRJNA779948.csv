abstract
"Immediate early genes (IEGs) represent a unique class of genes with rapid induction kinetics and transient expression patterns, which requires IEG mRNAs to be short-lived. Here, we establish cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 4 (CPEB4) as a major determinant of IEG mRNA instability. We identified human CPEB4 as an RNA-binding protein (RBP) with enhanced association to poly(A) RNA upon inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), which is known to cause widespread degradation of poly(A)-containing mRNA. Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) analysis using endogenously tagged CBEP4 in HeLa cells revealed that CPEB4 preferentially binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of IEG mRNAs, at U-rich sequence motifs located in close proximity to the poly(A) site. By transcriptome-wide mRNA decay measurements, we found that the strength of CPEB4 binding correlates with short mRNA half-lives, and that loss of CBEP4 expression leads to the stabilization of IEG mRNAs. Further, we demonstrate that CPEB4 mediates mRNA degradation by recruitment of the evolutionarily conserved CCR4-NOT complex, the major eukaryotic deadenylase. While CPEB4 is primarily known for its ability to stimulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation, our findings establish an additional function for CPEB4 as an RBP that enhances the degradation of short-lived IEG mRNAs. Overall design: Preparation of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) followed by RNA-Seq to determine ribosome densities."
