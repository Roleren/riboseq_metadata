abstract
Our aim in this study is to investigate target of rapamycin (TOR) mediated translational regulation using a ribo-seq approach in Arabidopsis thaliana cell culture. Arabidopsis dark grown cells were treated with and without the TOR inhibitor AZD upon nutrient supply and the translational changes were monitored 3 and 12 hours after nutrient supply.
