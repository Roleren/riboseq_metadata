abstract
We used RNAseq to evaluate baseline expression of NPAS+ VP translatomes in comparison to bulk VP translatomes. Overall design: We performed gene expression profiling in ribosome-associated mRNA from two different mouse genotypes (NPAS-Cre x Rpl22-HA or Rpl22-HA with Cre AAV in the VP) at baseline
