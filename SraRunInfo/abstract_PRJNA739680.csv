abstract
"Using an EMT lineage-tracing model, we identified tumor cells in the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET. Further analyses revealed that the ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) pathway was specifically elevated in these transitioning cells, regardless of their destined phenotypical fates. Overall design: mRNA profiling of flow cytometry sorted RFP+, GFP+, and Double+ Tri-PyMT cells. 3 samples of each type of cells were sequenced."
