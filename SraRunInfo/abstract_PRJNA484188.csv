abstract
"We show here that SDOS interacts with another important cancer-linked protein, the chaperone TRAP1, associates with actively translating polyribosomes and represses translation. Moreover, we demonstrate that SDOS binds directly RNA in living cells. Combining individual gene expression profiling, nucleotide cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP), and ribosome profiling, we discover several crucial pathways regulated post-transcriptionally by SDOS. Overall design: iCLIP combined with high-throughput sequencing was used to generate a transcriptome-wide binding map of SDOS."
