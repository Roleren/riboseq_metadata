"Here we translationally profiled the transcriptome of Crh-expressing neurons (Crh neurons) within the CeA following fear conditioning (FC) and fear extinction (EXT) in mice using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) followed by RNA sequencing. A tone alone group (TA) was used as a control group. Overall design: Individual animals were used as each sample (3 groups: FC, EXT and TA; n=10  males and females per group)."
