"G2019S mutaion of LRRK2 is known to increase mRNA translation. We perform ribosome profiling to study defective translation in mammalian LRRK2 models. We used G2019S LRRK2 transgenic mice, G2019S/D1994A LRRK2 transgenic mice, LRRK2 knockout mice. Overall design: Mouse: 3 months old. Biological replicates were generated for mouse experiments."
