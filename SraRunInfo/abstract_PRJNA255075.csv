abstract
"We present a high-throughput in vivo method to identify odorant receptors responding to odorants, using phosphorylated ribosome immunoprecipitation of mRNA from olfactory epithelium of odor-stimulated mice followed by RNA-Seq. Overall design: pS6-IP RNA-Seq in odor stimulated vs control mice olfactory epithelium"
