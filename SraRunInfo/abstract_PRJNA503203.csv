"We report ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq data of S.cerevisiae strains with TMA20, TMA64 single- and TMA20/TMA64 double-gene knockouts, grown in the rich YPD or minimal SD medium. Overall design: Yeast cells of 4 different S. cerevisiae strains, namely:  ?tma20, ?tma64, ??tma20tma64 knockout strains and the wild-type BY4741, were maintained in YPD or SD media. Two biological replicates were performed for wild-type strain, maintained in YPD media. Ribosomal profiling experiments of the wild-type and knockout strains grown in different media were performed. The ?DNA libraries were obtained from total 9 RNA samples and 9 ribosome-bound RNA samples."
