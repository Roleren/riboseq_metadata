abstract
"Translation complexes are stabilised in vivo using formaldehyde. Cells are lysed, and cell extracts are treated with RNase I to produce protected RNA fragments (FPs or footprints).  Extracts are then run through sucrose gradients to separate small ribosomal subunits and full ribosomes. FPs are isolated from each of these fractions and analysed by sequencing.  Note this is a modified version of ribo-seq (a.k.a. ribosome profiling)"
