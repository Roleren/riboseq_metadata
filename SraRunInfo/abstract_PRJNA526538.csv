abstract
"We developed a hybrid-sequencing workflow, combining next-generation and third-generation sequencing, to reconstruct full-length transcriptomes. Integrating with polysome profiling and ribosome footprinting data, we predicted isoformâ€“specific translational status and reconstructed ORFeome. Moreover, we identified isoforms with specific subcellular localization pattern in neurons. Overall design: At least two replicates were performed on the adult rat hippocampus."
