"To investigate the translatome change due to loss of MYSM1 in CD34+CD45RA-CD90+ cells We performed ribosome profiling followed by NGS sequencing where only ribosome protected RNA was extracted to make the library, which mostly are in active translation Overall design: comparative ribosome profiling assay of MYSM1 or AAVS1 edited CD34+CD45RA-CD90+ cells with three biological replicates of each group"
