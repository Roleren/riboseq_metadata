"Ribosome profiling with translation inhibitors reveals pervasive translation in murine ES cells. Overall design: Ribosome profiling or stranded RNAseq (ribominus) with murine embryonic stem cells treated with either DMD-pateamineA, Puromycin, Harringtonine or vehicle (no drug control). Two replicates per condition."
