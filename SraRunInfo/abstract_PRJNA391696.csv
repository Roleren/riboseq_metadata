abstract
"We analyze gene regulatory mechanisms involved in adrenocortical steroidogenesis using assays to measure RNA expression, synthesis, decay, processing, translation and miRNA expression. Overall design: Metabolic labeling, ribosome profiling and small RNA-sequencing was performed on human H295R adrenocortical cell lines with and without treatment with angiotensin or forskolin. RNA-seq was performed on adrenal glands of p15 c57bl/6 mice."
