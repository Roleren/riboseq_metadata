abstract
"Impairment of translation can lead to stalling and collision of ribosomes which constitute an activation platform for several ribosomal stress-surveillance pathways. Among these is the Ribotoxic Stress Response (RSR), where ribosomal sensing by the MAP3K ZAKa leads to activation of p38 and JNK kinases. Despite these insights, the physiological ramifications of ribosomal impairment and downstream RSR signaling remain elusive. Here we show that stalling of ribosomes is sufficient to activate ZAKa. In response to amino acid deprivation and full nutrient starvation, RSR impacts on the ensuing metabolic responses in cells, nematodes and mice. The RSR-regulated responses in these model systems include regulation of AMPK and mTOR signaling, survival under starvation conditions, stress hormone production and regulation of blood sugar control. In addition, ZAK-/- mice present with a lean phenotype. Our work highlights stalled ribosomes as metabolic signals and demonstrates a role for RSR signaling in metabolic regulation.
