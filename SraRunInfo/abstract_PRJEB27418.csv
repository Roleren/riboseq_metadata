abstract
Ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) and RNA-Seq analysis of eEF3 depletion in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). eEF3 depletion was induced by methionine in a modified strain where the native promoter was replaced by methionine repressible MET25 promoter. Conditional depletion enables us to study global effects of an essential gene.
