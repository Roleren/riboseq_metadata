abstract
"We investigate the mechanism by which glucose restriction extends yeast replicative lifespan, using an approach that combines ribosomal profiling and RNA-seq. We systematically compared the translational and transcriptional profiles of cells grown in glucose restriction and normal media, uncovering groups of functionally related genes that are up or down regulated. Overall design: We used two different protocols to grow cell culture in SD vs. GR conditions.  1) protocol-1: Quick Dilution from SD (2% glucose) to GR (0.05% glucose): the initial cell culture was incubated in SD medium overnight to OD600 0.8~1.0, then diluted by 5 fold using SD media and incubated for another 4 hours. The sample was then divided equally into two aliquots. One was diluted  40 times by pre-warmed SD medium with 0% glucose to reach final 0.05% glucose concentration (the sample), and the other diluted 40 times by pre-warmed SD medium with 2% glucose (the control). Both samples were incubated for another hour before harvesting. All the steps were carried out at 30°C.  2) protocol-2: Spin-down and re-suspension from SD to GR : the initial cell culture was incubated in SD medium overnight to a OD600 0.8~1.0, then diluted by 5 fold using SD medium and incubated for another 4 hours.  The sample was then divided equally into 2 aliquots. Cells were separated from the media by spin-down at 2000 rcf for 5 minutes and re-suspended into SD and GR media respectively. All samples were incubated for for another hour before harvesting. All the steps were carried out at 30°C.  Ribosomal profiling experiments were carried out using the protocol developed by Ingolia et al.  Raw sequences were obtained from Illumina Hiseq 2000."
