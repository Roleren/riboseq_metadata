abstract
"17ÃŸ-estradiol (E2) pollution has attracted much attention, and the existence of E2 poses certain risks to the environment and human health. However, the mechanism of microbial degradation of E2 remains unclear. In this study, the location of E2-degrading enzymes was investigated, and transcriptome analysis of Microbacterium resistens MZT7 (M. resistens MZT7) exposed to E2. The degradation of E2 by M. resistens MZT7 was via the biological action of E2-induced intracellular enzymes. With the RNA sequencing, we found 1,109 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among, 773 genes were up-regulated and 336 genes were down-regulated. The results of the RNA sequencing indicated the DEGs were related to transport, metabolism, and stress response. Genes for transport, transmembrane transport, oxidoreductase activity, ATPase activity, transporter activity and quorum sensing were up-regulated. Genes for tricarboxylic acid cycle, ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation and carbon metabolism were down-regulated. These findings provide some new insights into the molecular mechanism of biotransformation of E2 by M. resistens MZT7. Overall design: In this study, we first localized the E2 degrading enzyme. Then we investigated the transcriptional differences between E2-treated and non-E2-treated strain MZT7 by RNA-seq technology to reveal the degradation mechanism and its response to E2 at the transcriptional level."
