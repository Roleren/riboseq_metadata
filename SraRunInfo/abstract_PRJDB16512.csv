"N7-methylguanosine (m7G) in the variable loop region of tRNA is catalyzed by METTL1/WDR4 heterodimer and stabilizes target tRNA. Here, we reveal essential functions of Mettl1 in Drosophila fertility. Knockout of Mettl1 (Mettl1-KO) lost the elongated spermatids and mature sperm, which was fully rescued by a Mettl1-transgene expression, but not a catalytic-dead Mettl1 transgene. This demonstrates that Mettl1-dependent m7G is required for spermatogenesis. Mettl1-KO resulted in a loss of m7G modification on a subset of tRNAs and a decreased level of tRNA expression. Strikingly, overexpression of the translational elongation factor, EF1alpha1, which can compete with the rapid tRNA decay (RTD) pathway in S. cerevisiae, significantly counteracted the sterility of Mettl1-KO males, supporting a critical role of m7G modification of tRNAs in spermatogenesis. Ribosome profiling showed that Mettl1-KO led to the ribosome stalling at codons decoded by tRNAs that were reduced in expression. Mettl1-KO also significantly reduced the translation efficiency of genes involved in elongated spermatid formation and sperm stability. These findings reveal a developmental role for m7G tRNA modifications and indicate that m7G modification-dependent tRNA stability differs among tissues. Overall design: TRAC-seq were performed to identify the m7G-modified tRNAs using gonads of Mettl1-KO and wild-type flies. Ribosome profiling was conducted to measure the changes in translation of genes related to sperm development using testes of Mettl1-KO and wild-type male flies."
