"Adult Cardiac hypoxia as a crucial pathogenesis factor can induce detrimental effects on cardiac injury and dysfunction. The global transcriptome and translatome reflecting the cellular response to hypoxia have not yet been extensively studied in myocardium. In this study, adult rats were subjected to acute normobaric hypoxia at 10% oxygen with 10 min (mild hypoxia) and 30 min (severe hypoxia). Rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes were treated with the culture condition (1% O2, 94% N2, and 5% CO2) for mild hypoxia (8 hr) and severe hypoxia(24 hr). We then conducted RNA-seq and Ribo-seq in non-infarcted left ventricular myocardial tissues and H9C2 cells exposed to different periods of hypoxia stress in vivo and in vitro."
