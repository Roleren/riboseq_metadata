"Ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) analysis of murine 17 clone 1 (17Cl-1) cells with and without MHV infection. We sought to assess the impact of differing library preparation methods by using three separate approaches: flash freezing, 1X cycloheximide pretreatment, and 100X cycloheximide pretreatment."
