abstract
"We investigated the molecular dynamics driving relapse of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) through an integrated analysis of whole exome, bulk transcriptome, bulk methylome and single cell transcriptional data from paired leukemic samples representing 19 patients. We found that their clinical kinetics corresponded to distinct genetic and epigenetic evolutionary trajectories and suggest that the selection pressures of the post-transplant, immunologic bottleneck are distinct from those imposed by chemotherapy.In order to discover cancer antigens derived from annotated and unannotated protein-coding regions of the genome, we carried out ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and RNA-sequencing on CLL samples and isolated primary...
