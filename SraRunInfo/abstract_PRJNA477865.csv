abstract
"We investigated how RNA interference contends with ongoing translation by examining the fate of actively translated mRNAs subjected to RNAi in C. elegans. We performed RNAi in wild-type animals, skih-2 mutants, and skih-2 pelo-1 double mutants to investigate whether SKI (an RNA helicase) and PELOTA (a ribosome rescue factor) have a role in co-translational RNAi. Each library contains a single dsRNA trigger targeting a single gene. In total five triggers were tested in three genes (unc-15, unc-22, and unc-54). We quantified RNA levels and ongoing translation by RNA-seq and Ribo-seq (ribosome footprinting), respectively. For Ribo-seq, we performed two similar but distinct preparations: size selection for ""normal"" length ribosome footprints (28-30nt), as well as size selection for ""short"" footprints (15-18nt)."
