"SECIS binding protein 2 (SECISBP2) increases the efficiency of recoding of UGA codons as selenocysteine (Sec) during translation of mRNAs containing a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in the 3'-untranslated region. Using ribosomal profiling, we have previously studied selenoprotein translation in hepatocyte-specific Secisbp2-deficient mouse liver and neuron-specific Secisbp2-mutant mouse brain. The use of organs carries the limitation of cellular heterogeneity with cells still expressing wild-type SECISBP2 that might potentially confound analyses and conclusions. To address this concern, we studied a haploid human HAP1 cell line carrying a non-functional SECISBP2 protein. These cells are still capable of metabolically incorporating 75Se into selenoproteins. We performed ribosomal profiling, and show that the efficiency of UGA recoding is gene-specific in SECISBP2- deficient cells. Analysis of ribosomes with UGA either at the A-site or the P-site revealed in a transcript-specific manner that SECISBP2 helps to recruit tRNASec and stabilizes mRNA. We propose a new measure to assess UGA/Sec read-through at codon resolution in all selenoproteins, i.e. the proportion of ribosomes carrying UGA in the P-site, pUGA. An additional, new observation is frame- shifting occurring after the UGA/Sec codon in GPX1, SELENOF, and SELENOW in HAP1 cells, a finding corroborated by reanalysis of neuron-specific Secisbp2-mutant brains. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and 3'-mRNA-sequencing of HAP1 Cell samples from 2 SECISBP2 KO replicates and 2 WT replicates"
