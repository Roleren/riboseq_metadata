abstract
"Although gene expression is tightly regulated during embryonic development, the impact of translational control has received less experimental attention. Here, we find that eukaryotic translation initiation factor-3 (eIF3) is required for Shh-mediated tissue patterning.  Analysis of loss-of-function  eIF3 subunit c (Eif3c) mice reveal a unique sensitivity to the Shh receptor Patched 1 (Ptch1) dosage. Genome-wide in vivo enhanced cross-linking immunoprecipitation sequence (eCLIP-seq) shows unexpected specificity for eIF3 binding to a pyrimidine rich motif present in subsets of 5'-UTRs and a corresponding change in the translation of these transcripts by ribosome profiling in Eif3c loss-of-function embryos. We further find that while Eif3c loss-of-function embryos do not show a global decrease in protein synthesis, translation of Ptch1 through this pyrimidine rich motif is specifically sensitive to eIF3 amount. Altogether, this work uncovers hidden specificity of housekeeping translation initiation machinery for the translation of key developmental signaling transcripts. Overall design: eCLIP-seq"
