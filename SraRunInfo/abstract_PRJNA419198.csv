abstract
"We systemically investigated the circRNA profiles among the subcellular fractions of HepG2 cell, including nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, ribosome, cytosol and exosome. Our studies reveals the wide distribution of circRNAs among the subcellular fractions except the mitochondria. Further comparative analysis indicate the differential subcellular distributions in expression, length, GC content, classification, alternative circularization and function of the parental genes. Through analyzing the binding motifs distribution of the transport-related RBPs among the subcellular circRNAs, we found that the different subcellular distribution characteristics of circRNAs might be resulted from the RBP-mediated selective transportation. It also implies that the circRNAs may follow the same transportation mechanism as linear RNAs: the RBPs specially recognize, bind to and transport the RNAs with the corresponding binding motifs, regardless of circular or linear RNAs. Our researches not only facilitate better understanding of the life history and molecular behavior of circRNA in cell, but also contribute to the exploration for new biological functions of circRNA. Overall design: Examined seven fractions of HepG2 (cell, nucleus, cytoplasm, ribsome, cytosol, exosome, mitochodria) and each has two repeats"
