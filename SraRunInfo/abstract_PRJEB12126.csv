"""Ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) (maps positions of translating ribosomes on the transcriptome) and RNASeq (quantifies the transcriptome) analysis of murine 17 clone 1 (17Cl-1) cells infected with Murine coronavirus strain A59 (MHV-A59). Samples comprise 1 and 8 h mocks, 1, 2.5, 5 and 8 h post infection timecourse, for each of RiboSeq with cycloheximide (CHX), RiboSeq with harringtonine (HAR), and RNASeq, performed in duplicate (6 x 3 x 2 libraries); RiboSeq CHX, RiboSeq HAR and RNASeq at 1 h post infection for high multiplicity of infection (3 libraries); and 1 \""""long-read\"""" library for 5 h post infection RiboSeq CHX to test for larger-than-normal ribosome footprints."""
