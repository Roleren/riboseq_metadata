abstract
"METTL16 was previously identified as an m6A methyltransferase. In this study, we validated the cytoplasmic location of METTL16 and explored its function in the cytoplasm. We found that METTL16 promoted translation by sequestering eIF4E2, a translation initiation repressor, from the 5' cap structure. Overall design: Overall design: One sgRNA against METTL16 groups with two hybrid clones, one shRNAs against METTL16 groups, one shRNA against EIF4E2 groups with two bio-replicates, one sgNS group and two shNS group were subjected to ribosome profiling and both the input RNA and footprint RNAs were used for sequencing."
