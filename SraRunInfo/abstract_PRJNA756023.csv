abstract
"Small open reading frames (smORFs) can have important regulatory roles and give rise to stable proteins, yet their discovery based on sequence-based predictions and proteomics has been challenging. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) data can provide valuable experimental evidence of RNA translation. Stringent analysis of P-sites, representing 1.3 billion high-confidence ribosome locations, revealed 5308 uORFs, 1652 smORFs in lincRNAs and 807 dORFs that are translated in humans. We here provide a comprehensive database of Ribo-seq smORFs for a more complete understanding of the translated human genome. Overall design: To validate smORF findings on a genome-wide level, we have collected, generated and processed RNAseq data from six primary human cell types and two human tissues."
