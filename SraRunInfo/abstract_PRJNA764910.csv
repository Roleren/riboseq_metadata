abstract
"We performed ribosome profiling in HEK293T cells with treatment with either C13-benzamidyl cycloheximide (hereafter ""benzamide"") or cycloheximide. Overall design: In order to evaluate the effect that the benzamide has on genome-wide ribosome occupancy, we performed ribosome profiling in duplicate and compared 1-minute pretreatment with 350 µM benzamide or with 350 µM cycloheximide."
