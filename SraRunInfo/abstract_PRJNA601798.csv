"Abrupt drought-flood alternation (T1) is a meteorological disaster that frequently occurs during summer in southern China and the Yangtze river basin. Studying the physiological and translational dynamic mechanism of rice yield recovery after abrupt drought-flood alternation has great potential benefits for production application. The main reason for the yield recovery of nitrogen (N) supply after abrupt drought-flood alternation (T1_N) was the increase in effective panicle per plant. N application is achieved by regulating the physiological and biochemical processes such as endogenous hormone balance, N metabolism enzymes, antioxidant enzyme activities, photosynthesis, osmotic adjustment substances, dry matter accumulation and transport, and N absorption and utilization to achieve rapid growth recovery effect after abrupt drought-flood alternation stress in rice. Using ribosome profiling combined with RNA-seq sequencing technology, analysis of the interaction between transcription and translation of N supply recovery after abrupt drought-flood alternation has shown that a small proportion of response genes (14.0% of up-regulated genes and 6.6% of down-regulated genes) were shared between transcription and translation level, which revealed the independence of N supply recovery transcription and translation response after abrupt drought-flood alternation. Further analysis shows that the translation efficiency (TE) of the gene is greatly influenced by its sequence characteristics, including GC content, coding sequence length and normalized minimum free energy. Genome-wide analysis found that 7003 genes contained upstream open reading frames (uORFs). compared with untranslated uORFs, the increased number of translated uORFs promoted the improvement of TE. The TE of uORF in T1_N is lower than that TE of uORF in T1 on a genome-wide basis. This study defines the genome-wide translation regulation pattern of N supply after abrupt drought-flood alternation stress, which is helpful to understand the highly dynamic translation mechanism of rice and provides insights for future field production and breeding."
