abstract
"Here, we identified  METTL6 as a bona fide tRNA methyltransferase, catalysing the formation of 3-methylcytidine (m3C) at C32 of specific serine tRNA isoacceptors. Accordingly, deletion of METTL6 in mouse stem cells results in changes in ribosome occupancy and RNA levels, as well as a spontaneous loss of pluripotency Overall design: Two biological replicates of RNAseq + Ribosome profiling for METTL6 KO G6 and WT mESCs"
