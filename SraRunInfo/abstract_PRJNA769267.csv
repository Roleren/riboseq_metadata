abstract
We performed ribosome profiling to determine  the effect of FBL knockdown on mRNA translation in human leukemai cell Kasumi-1. Overall design: Kasumi-1 cells stably expressing doxcyxycline inducible control or FBL specific shRNA were used. Cells were treated with 100 ng/ml doxcyxycline for three days to induce the expression of shRNA. Cells were then collected for Ribosome profiling.
