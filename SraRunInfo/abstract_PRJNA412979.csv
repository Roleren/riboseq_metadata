"To characterize the translation defects in Maf1-/- samples, we used ribosome profiling on three WT and three Maf1-/- fed livers. Each sample was spiked with a fixed amount of Drosophila S2 Schneider cell material as an internal control for sample-to-sample normalization, and to allow detection of global changes in translation. Overall design: Two conditions (WT of Maf1 KO mice), three biological replicates per condition. For each sample, both Ribosome-protected fragments (RPFL) and total RNA fragments (TOTL) were sequenced."
