"NSP1 is a major shutoff factor of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The functions of NSP1 and its contribution to SARS-CoV-2 propagation is not well understood. We tackled these questions utilizing methods such as RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and SLAMseq. Overall design: To decipher SARS-CoV-2 NSP1's functions, we performed RNA sequencing following overexpression and fractionation of the wt protein and of two mutants. We also performed SLAMseq analysis on cell overexpressed with NSP1wt and with a mutated NSP1, and on cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or with a SARS-CoV-2?nsp1 mutated virus. Additionally, we performed ribosome profiling on cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or with the SARS-CoV-2?nsp1 mutant."
