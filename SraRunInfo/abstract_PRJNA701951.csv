abstract
"The transcription factor p53 exerts its tumor suppressive effects through transcriptional activation of numerous target genes controlling cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cellular senescence and DNA repair. In addition, there is evidence that p53 influences the translation of specific mRNAs, including translational attenuation of ribosomal protein synthesis and translational activation of MDM2. A challenge in the analysis of translational control is that changes in mRNA abundance exert a kinetic (passive) effect on ribosome densities. In order to separate these passive effects from active regulation of translation efficiency in response to p53 activation, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of translational regulation by comparative analysis of mRNA levels and ribosome densities upon DNA damage induced by neocarzinostatin in wild-type and TP53-/- HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells. Thereby, we identified a specific group of mRNAs whose translation is actively up-regulated in response to p53 activation, the majority of which are transcribed from p53 target genes including MDM2, SESN1 and CDKN1A. By subsequent polysome profile analysis, we could demonstrate that a p53-dependent switch in transcript isoform expression is responsible for translational activation of SESN1, whereas translational activation of CDKN1A occurs through a trans-acting mechanism that affects multiple transcript isoforms. Overall design: RNaseI digested ribosome footprint of cytoplasmic mRNAs or monosome fraction after sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, or alkaline fragmentated total mRNA in HCT116 WT and TP53-/- cells upon neocarzinostatin treatment"
