abstract
We used Ribo-seq (Ribosome profiling) combining with RNA-seq to explore the translational landscape of Arabidopsis Col-0 seedling. We generated 6 biological replicates of RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data for Arabidopsis Col-0 seedling. 3 of the replicates were collected after 20 minutes of 0.1% DMSO treatment and the other 3 samples were collected after 60 minutes of DMSO treatmeant. The resulting RNA-seq and Ribo-seq files were used to discover translated up-stream ORFs (uORFs) and analyze the translation efficiency of uORF-containing genes in Arabidopsis. Overall design: 6 biological replicates of 7-day old Arabidopsis seedling collected and processed for Ribo-seq and RNA-seq sample preparation. The Ribo-seq library was sequenced with illumina single-end 50 sequencing and the RNA-seq library was sequenced with illumina paired-end 100 sequencing.
