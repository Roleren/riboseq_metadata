abstract
"Using dynamic ribosome profiling, we identified three translation initiation sites in the intron upstream of GGGGCC; these sites are detected irrespective of the presence or absence of the repeat. Overall design: Identification of translation initiation sites for C9ORF72 in iPSCs and HEK cells expressing a C9ORF72 reporter"
