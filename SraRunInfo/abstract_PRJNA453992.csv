abstract
"N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) and N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) are abundant mRNA modifications that regulate transcript processing and translation. The role of both, here termed m6A/m, in the stress response in the adult brain in vivo are currently unknown.  Here, we provide ribosome profiling data of 10-12 w male C57BL/6 mouse cortex of unstressed or acutely stressed mice (4 h after 15 min restraint stress) of 6 samples per condition to relate to m6A/m-Seq data of similiar samples. Overall design: 6 replicates of basal mouse cortex (""Control"", ""C""), 6 replicates for stressed mouse cortex (4 h after 15 min of restraint stress, ""Stress"", ""S"")."
