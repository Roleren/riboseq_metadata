abstract
"We present a genome-wide assessment of the translation of small open reading frames (smORF) in Drosophila melanogaster mRNAs, using ribosomal profiling of polysomal fractions in three contiguous temporal windows, which encopass all of embryogenesis. We also performed the same protocol using S2 cells. In this way, mRNAs bound by multiple ribosomes can be isolated and distinguished from mRNAs bound by sporadic, putatively non-productive single ribosomes or ribosomal subunits. Overall design: Ribosomal profiling of polysomal fractions (Poly-Ribo-Seq) in Drosophila melanogasterembryos to assess translation of small ORFs"
