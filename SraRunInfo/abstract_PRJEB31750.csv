abstract
"YTHDF2 is overexpressed in a broad spectrum of human acute myeloid leukemias (AML). To study the role of YTHDF2 on translation regulation in leukemia, c-Kit+ cells from foetal livers of  Ythdf2fl/fl; Vav-iCre (Ythdf2CKO) and Ythdf2fl/fl (Ythdf2CTL) 14.5 dpc embryos were transduced with Meis1 and Hoxa9 oncogenes and serially re-plated to generate pre-leukemic cells. RIBO-seq libraries were then prepared from Ythdf2CKO (n=3) and Ythdf2CTL (n=3) pre-leukemic cells."
