"Ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) and RNA-Seq analysis of mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro2a) cells infected with Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) P20778 Vellore strain. At 18 h post infection (p.i.), infected cells were treated with either cycloheximide (translation elongation inhibitor) or in combination with harringtonine (translation initiation inhibitor). Ribo-Seq libraries were prepared using a broad range of fragment lengths (25 to 70 nucleotides) and deep sequenced. This allowed for estimation of ribosomal frameshifting efficiency and discovery of a novel upstream open reading frame (uORF) in JEV along with perturbations in ribosome-associated tRNA levels upon JEV infection."
