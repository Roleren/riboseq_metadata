abstract
"The genetic code that specifies the identity of amino acids incorporated into proteins during protein synthesis is almost universally conserved. Mitochondrial translation deviates from the standard genetic code which includes the reassignment of two arginine codons into stop codons {Jukes, 1993 #438}. Translation termination at these non-canonical stop codons requires a protein factor to release the newly synthesized polypeptide chain, however, the identity of this factor is not known currently{Nadler, 2021 #406}. Here, we used gene editing and ribo-profiling in combination with cryo-electron microscopy to establish that the unusual mitochondrial release factor 1 (mtRF1) detects the non-canonical stop codons. We show that loss of mtRF1 leads to stalling of mitochondrial ribosomes on non-canonical stop codons and consequent reduced translation of cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 that results in decreased mitochondrial respiration. We show that binding of mtRF1 to the decoding center of the ribosome stabilizes a highly unusual distortion in the mRNA conformation and that the ribosomal RNA importantly participates in the specific recognition of the non-canonical stop codons. Overall design: Ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) of mtRF1 KO and WT CAL51 cells (n=1)"
