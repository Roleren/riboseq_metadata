abstract
"ALKBH5 is the RNA N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase. To understhand the function and mechnism of ALKBH5 in human acute myeloid leukemia, we compared the translational efficiency in wild-type and ALKBH5-knock-down THP1 cells. Overall design: Ribo-seq in wild-type or ALKBH5 knock-down THP1 cells"
