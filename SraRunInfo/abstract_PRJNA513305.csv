abstract
"To investigate whether natural TAG was decoded by stably transfected Mb pyltRNA in transgenic cells, their cell lysate was subjected to ribosome profiling, examining the physical locations of ribosomes. HEK293T cells were taken as control. Overall design: Examine the physical locations of ribosomes in both transgenic and HEK293T cells"
