abstract
"Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) degrades transcripts carrying premature termination codons. NMD is thought to prevent the synthesis of toxic truncated proteins. However, whether loss of NMD results in widespread production of truncated proteins is unclear. A human genetic disease, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), features acute inhibition of NMD upon expression of the disease-causing transcription factor, DUX4. Using a cell-based model of FSHD, we show production of truncated proteins from physiological NMD targets and find that RNA-binding proteins are enriched for aberrant truncations. The NMD isoform of one RNA-binding protein, SRSF3, is translated to produce a stable truncated protein, which is detected in FSHD patient-derived myotubes. Ectopic expression of truncated SRSF3 confers toxicity, and its downregulation is cytoprotective. Our results delineate the genome-scale impact of NMD loss. This widespread production of potentially deleterious truncated proteins has implications for FSHD biology as well as other genetic diseases where NMD is therapeutically modulated. Overall design: Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) of human myoblasts harboring an inducible DUX4 transgene was performed on ribosome-protected RNA samples collected from 3 separate biological replicates treated for 0, 4, 8, or 14 h with doxycycline to induce DUX4 expression."
