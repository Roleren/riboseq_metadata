"To identify new potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of GB we performed ribosome profiling of glioblastoma sphere cultures (GSCs) under normal and radiotherapeutic conditions. Overall design: Glioma sphere cultures were left untreated (t0), or irradiated and harvested 30 min (t1) or 60 min (t2) after irradiation"
