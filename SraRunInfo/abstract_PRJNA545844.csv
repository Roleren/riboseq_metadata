abstract
"In this work, we used quantitative proteomics to investigate the acetylomes regulated by rice RPD3 family HDAC proteins in seedlings. Our results establish an unprecedentedly comprehensive protein acetylome in plants and reveal that HDA714 is a major deacetylase targeting a large number of Kac sites on hundreds of proteins of diverse function. We show that HDA714-dependent deacetylation is required for glycolytic activity, ribosome translational function, and plant growth and development. Our data uncovers novel regulators of protein Kac homeostasis in plants and extends the role of protein Kac in gene expression to translational regulation."
