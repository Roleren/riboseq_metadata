abstract
"We profiled the gene expression patterns of undisturbed endothelial cells in living animals using a novel 'AngioTag' zebrafish transgenic line that permits isolation of actively translating mRNAs from endothelial cells in their native environment. This transgenic line uses the endothelial cell-specific kdrl promoter to drive expression of an epitope tagged Rpl10a 60S ribosomal subunit protein, allowing for Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) of actively translating endothelial cell mRNAs.  We also collected the whole embryo translatome using the TRAP protocol and a ubiquitously expressed tagged Rpl10a, and the endothelial transcritome by collecting the GFP+ endothelial cells that had the kdrl promoter driving GFP. Overall design: Examination of 24hpf zebrafish whole embryo translatome, 24hpf zebrafish endothelial translatome, and 24hpf zebrafish endothelial transciptome"
