"In this study, the model cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was grown in an artificial day-night cycle regime (turbidostat culture). To analyze changes in transcription and translation over the day-night cycle, cell samples were collected at five diurnal time points for mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) and Ribosome Profiling (RP). The time points were: 1h before sunrise (A), 1h after sunrise (B), midday (C), 1h before sunset (D), and 1h after sunset (E). Samples were collected from two replicate cultivations, ""cult1"" and ""cult2"". RNAseq samples were collected in cult1 over two day-night cycles (1 and 2). Ribosome profiling samples were collected in cult1 over two day-night cycles (1 and 2), and in cult2 over one day-night cycle (1). Samples were collected in triplicates for each diurnal time point (condition A-E), except 1h after sunrise, where ribosome profiling samples were collected in triplicates. Sequencing libraries were created using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (RNAseq) and the NEBNext small RNA library prep set (RP). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 platform (75-bp read length, single end)."
