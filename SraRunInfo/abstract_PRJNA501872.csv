abstract
"SETD2 is the specific methyltransferase of H3K36me3, while METTL14 is a critical subunit of the m6A methyltransferase complex. To evaluate the effect of SETD2 and METTL14 on translation, we conducted robosome profiling in SETD2 and METTL14 knockdown and control HepG2 cells. Our RNA ribosome profiling revealed that depletion of SETD2 and METTL14 resulted in a global reduction in RNA translation and the changes of translation efficiency were correlated between SETD2 and METTL14 knockdown cells. Overall design: We performed active ribosome profiling in HepG2 cells with stably expressed SETD2, METTL14 or control shRNA."
