abstract
Mycoplasma gallisepticum as well as other species of the Mollicutes class feature significantly reduced genome. Previously we identified that the heat stress results in drastic changes of the transcription profile but these changes are poorly reflected on the protein level. Here we used RNA-seq strategy for sequencing mRNAs associated with ribosomes under the normal and the heat stress conditions to study genetic information transfer from RNA to protein in M. gallisepticum. We observed significant upregulation of the small CDSs. Substantial part of the small CDSs is more controlled by terminators of the previous CDSs rather than promoters. Among mRNAs with known function we observed 10-fold upregulation of mRNA coding for homologs of the immunoglobulin-blocking protein M from M. genitalium and also DCW (Division Cell Wall) cluster mRNA. Downregulated transcripts are enriched in mRNAs coding for the ribosomal proteins. Investigation of secondary structure in the upstream region of mRNA showed a weak influence stability of the secondary structure to mRNA abundance in the ribosome-bound fraction. Our results can reveal mechanisms that control binding of mRNAs to ribosomes under the normal and the stress conditions.
