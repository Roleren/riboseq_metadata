"Major Histocompatibility Complex I (MHC-I) CNS cellular localization and function is still being determined after previously being thought to be absent from the brain. MHC-I expression has been reported to increase with brain aging in mouse, rat, and human whole tissue analyses. Neuronal MHC-I has been proposed to regulate developmental synapse elimination and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report that across newly generated and publicly available ribosomal profiling, cell sorting, and single-cell data, microglia were the primary source of classical and non-classical MHC-I in mice and humans. Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP)-qPCR analysis of 3-6 and 18-22 month old (m.o.) mice revealed significant age-related microglial induction of MHC-I pathway genes B2m, H2-D1, H2-K1, H2-M3, H2-Q6, and Tap1 but not in astrocytes and neurons. Across a timecourse (12-23 m.o.), microglial MHC-I gradually increased until 21 m.o. and then accelerated. MHC-I protein was also enriched in microglia and increased with aging. Microglial expression, and absence in astrocytes and neurons, of MHC-I binding Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like (Lilrs) and Paired immunoglobin-like type 2 (Pilrs) receptor families could enable cell-autonomous MHC-I signaling and increased with aging in mice and humans. Increased microglial MHC-I, Lilrs, and Pilrs were observed in AD mouse models and human AD data is evident across numerous mouse models, methods, and studies. MHC-I expression correlated with p16INK4A, suggesting an association with cellular senescence. Conserved induction of MHC-I, Lilrs, and Pilrs with aging and AD opens the possibility of cell-autonomous MHC-I signaling to regulate microglial reactivation with aging and neurodegeneration. Overall design: RNA-Seq and qPCR of old and young mice to compare MHC-I expression with human data"
