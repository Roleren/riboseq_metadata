"We use ribosome profiling to compare the selectivity of two small molecules, PF-06446846 and PF-06378503 that inhibits translation of their target by selectively inducing ribosome-stalling in a nascent chain sequence dependent manner. Overall design: Huh7 cells were treated with 1.5 µM PF-06446846, 1.5µM PF-06378503 or vehicle for 60 minutes, and subjected to ribosome profiling. This study included three biological replicates"
