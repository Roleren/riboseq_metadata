"To investigate whether metoprolol treatment could affect the transcriptome and translatome of killing supernatant cultured human monocytes Overall design: PBMC were isolated from buffy coat of healthy blood donors by Ficoll gradients, and CD14+ monocytes were isolated from PBMC with anti-CD14 magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). CD14+ monocytes were cultured with killing supernatant  for 5 days and treated with metoprolol or PBS prophylactically or conditionally and then were sent for both ribo-seq and RNA-seq"
