"Input mRNAs and ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) from Heterozygout (Control) and Dis3l2 knockout (KO) mESCs cultures were analyzed by TruSeq Ribo Profile (Illumina) library preparation and high throughput sequencing Overall design: mESCs were cultured in LIF/Serum condition. Input mRNAs and RPFs were isolated, ribosomal RNAs were depleted and cDNA libraries were prepared according to the TruSeq Ribo Profile pipeline (Illumina)"
