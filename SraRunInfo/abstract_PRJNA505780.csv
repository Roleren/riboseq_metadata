"DNA damage activates a robust transcriptional stress response, but much less is known about how DNA damage impacts translation. The advent of genome editing with Cas9 has intensified interest in understanding cellular responses to DNA damage. Here, we find that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), including those induced by Cas9, trigger the loss of ribosomal protein RPS27A from ribosomes via p53-independent proteasomal degradation. Comparisons of Cas9 and dCas9 ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq experiments reveal a global translational response to DSBs that precedes changes in transcript abundance. Our results demonstrate that even a single DSB can lead to altered translational output and ribosome remodeling, suggesting caution in interpreting cellular phenotypes measured immediately after genome editing. Overall design: mRNA-Seq and ribosome profiling on HEK293 cells after inducing double-strand breaks by Cas9 RNP nucleofection, 36 hours and 72 hours after"
