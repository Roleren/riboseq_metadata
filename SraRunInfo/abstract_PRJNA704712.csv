"Co-evolution between hosts' and parasites' genomes shapes diverse pathways of acquired immunity based on silencing small (s)RNAs. In plants, sRNAs cause heterochromatinization, sequence-degeneration and, ultimately, loss-of-autonomy of most transposable elements (TEs). Recognition of newly-invasive plant TEs, by contrast, involves an innate antiviral-like silencing response. To investigate this response's activation, we studied the single-copy element EVADÃ‰ (EVD), one of few representatives of the large Ty1/Copia family able to proliferate in Arabidopsis when epigenetically-reactivated. In Ty1/Copia-elements, a short subgenomic mRNA (shGAG) provides the necessary excess of structural GAG protein over the catalytic components encoded by the full-length genomic flGAG-POL. We show here that the predominant cytosolic distribution of shGAG strongly favors its translation over mostly-nuclear flGAG-POL. During this process, an unusually intense ribosomal stalling event coincides with mRNA breakage yielding unconventional 5'OH RNA fragments that evade RNA-quality-control. The starting-point of sRNA production by RNA-DEPENDENT-RNA-POLYMERASE-6 (RDR6), exclusively on shGAG, occurs precisely at this breakage point. This hitherto-unrecognized ""translation-dependent silencing"" (TdS) is independent of codon-usage or GC-content and is not observed on TE remnants populating the Arabidopsis genome, consistent with their poor association, if any, with polysomes. We propose that TdS forms a primal defense against EVD de novo invasions that underlies its associated sRNA pattern. Overall design: Ribo-seq and sRNA-seq were performed on RNA from inflorescence tissue of EVD and GFP-EVD-GUS overexpressing plants. NanoPare and SMART-seq2 was perfomed on wild-type (Col-0) and ddm1-2 inflorescence tissue."
