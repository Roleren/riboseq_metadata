"The effects of RyhB expression were examined by Ribo-seq and RNA-seq after 10 min to avoid indirect effects. Expression of RyhB was induced by arabinose from cells carrying pBAD-ryhB plasmid. The RyhB expression was confirmed by real-time PCR. As a control, cells with vector pNM12 were grown and induced. The cells were pulverized and total mRNAs were extracted from the pulverized cells and processed for Ribo-seq and RNA-seq."
