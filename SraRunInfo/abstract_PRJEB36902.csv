abstract
"Many non-typhoidal serovars of Salmonella such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) are the leading cause of food-borne gastroenteritis, resulting in millions of infections each year and sometimes death. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is the most common non-typhoidal Salmonella strain isolated from patients around the world and is used as a mouse model to study bacterial pathogenesis and host-microbe interactions. Furthermore, S. Typhimurium is an important pathogen in livestock animals including chickens and cattle. S. Typhimurium utilises a multitude of virulence factors to reach and invade host cells and for its intracellular survival. However, little is known about the mechanism of protein synthesis of these virulence factors at the codon level. Here, we performed RNA-seq and ribosome profiling. Ribosome profiling allows the global mapping of translating ribosomes on the transcriptome and therefore provides direct measure of protein synthesis."
