"We determined the transcriptome specific to cardiomyocytes by crossing PKP2cKO mice with a RiboTag murine line. Active Cre-recombinase leads to expression of a Ribosomal Protein L22 (RPL22) that is modified in exon 4 to code for a 3-repeat HA tag (3HA). RPL22-3HA is expressed and incorporated into the ribosome particle, allowing its precipitation and subsequent detection of associated transcripts by RNA-seq. Given that Cre-ERT2 expression in our mice was controlled by the alphaMHC promoter, injection of TAM led to both, loss of PKP2 expression and expression of RPL22-3HA. We refer to this line as PKP2cKO/RiboTag."
