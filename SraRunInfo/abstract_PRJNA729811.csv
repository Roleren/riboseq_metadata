abstract
"The wheat genome has recently been sequenced and annotated. However, currently little, if any, is known about this genome at the translatome level. In this study, we used a ribo-seq strategy to perform global translatome analysis of wheat in response to Fusarium gramineaum. We describe the alternative translatome in wheat and the response of wheat to Fg infection at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Further, we found hundreds of novel unannotated ORFs, upstream and downstream ORFs and CDSs previously annotated as non-coding CDS in wheat genome annotation."
