"In order to profile the translation events that were regulated by RBMS1, Ribo-seq was performed on A549 cells which was used to generate RBMS1 stably depleted and overexpressed  lung cancer cells. Overall design: This study includes a total of 5 ribosome footprint profiling samples, A549_sh1196 and A549_sh1088 was generated as a RBMS1 stably depleted A549 lung cancer cells. A549_R1A was generated as a RBMS1 stably overexpressed A549 lung cancer cells ."
