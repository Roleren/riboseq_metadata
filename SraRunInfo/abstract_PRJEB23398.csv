abstract
"The functional consequences of many of the genetic changes, or combinations of genetic changes, in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) are not known, but it is essential to discover these in order to understand the biology of the disease and the causes of individual variation in response to novel and conventional treatments.   In this proof-of-principle study the translational landscape of CLL was determined for the first time by ribosome profiling.   Individual variation in response to stimuli from the tumour microenvironment has not been systematically explored previously, but is likely to influence response to treatment and survival."
