"Given the risk of Candida albicans overgrowth in the gut, novel complementary therapies should be developed to reduce fungal dominancy. This study highlights the antifungal characteristics of a Bacillus subtilis-derived secondary metabolite, surfactin with high potential against C. albicans. Surfactin inhibited the growth of C. albicans following a 1-hour exposure, in addition to reduced adhesion and morphogenesis. Specifically, surfactin did not affect the level of reactive oxygen species but increased the level of reduced glutathione. Surprisingly, ethanol production was increased following 2 hours of surfactin exposure. Surfactin treatment caused a significant reduction in intracellular iron, manganese and zinc content compared to control cells, whereas the level of copper was not affected. Alongside these physiological properties, surfactin also enhanced fluconazole efficacy. To gain detailed insights into the surfactin-related effects on C. albicans, genome-wide gene transcription analysis was performed. Surfactin treatment resulted in 1390 differentially expressed genes according to total transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Of these, 773 and 617 genes with at least a 1.5-fold increase or decrease in transcription, respectively, were selected for detailed investigation. Several genes involved in morphogenesis or related to metabolism (e.g., glycolysis, ethanol and fatty acid biosynthesis) were down-regulated. Moreover, surfactin decreased the expression of ERG1, ERG3, ERG9, ERG10 and ERG11 involved in ergosterol synthesis, whereas genes associated with ribosome biogenesis and iron metabolism and drug transport-related genes were up-regulated. Our data demonstrate that surfactin significantly influences the physiology and gene transcription of C. albicans, and could contribute to the development of a novel innovative complementary therapy. Overall design: Examination of untreated control and 128 mg/L surfactin-treated Candida albicans cultures in three replicates."
