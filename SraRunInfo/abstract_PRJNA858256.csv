abstract
"We present a combinatorial approach, integrating experimental data from small protein-optimized mass spectrometry (MS) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), to generate a high confidence inventory of small proteins in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. Overall design: Ribo-seq and RNA-seq experiments to study the transcriptome and the translatome of H. volcanii"
