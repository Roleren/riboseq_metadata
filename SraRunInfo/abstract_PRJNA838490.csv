"To identify DDX3X-dependent translation targets in the developing mouse cortex, we used E11.5 cortices from both sexes of wildtype and conditional Ddx3x knockout mice (driven by Emx1-Cre). We performed RNAseq and Riboseq on these samples in parallel. Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data for wildtype and Ddx3x conditional knockout mouse E11.5 cortex. The following are biological replicates: Female controls: F2, F3; Male controls: M1, M2, M3; cKO females: F1, F2, F3; cKO mals: M1, M2, M3"
