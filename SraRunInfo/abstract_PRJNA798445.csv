abstract
By performing ribosome profiling on squamous cell carcinoma stem cells (either control or S51A mutant) we found that the ISR translationally regulates a network of centrosomal proteins to help cellular recovery upon proteotoxic stress. Overall design: Ribosome profiling and total RNA sequencing were performed on control and S51A cells either vehicle-treated or treated with the proteosome inhibitor bortezomib for 4.5h
