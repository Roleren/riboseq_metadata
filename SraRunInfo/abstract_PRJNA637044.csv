abstract
"We present the data obtained from high-resolution ribosome profiling analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis grown under standard conditions (log phase) and cells subjected to oxidative stress (50 µM cumene hydroperoxide) and pH stress (pH 4.5). Our data shows pervasive ribosome pausing in the M. tb translatome. A large number of genes show very high pause immediately downstream to the translation start site. Moreover, serines and alanines in the E site of the ribosome exhibit highest pause scores. Overall design: Ribosome profiling analysis of M. tb grown to log phase, subjected to oxidative stress (50µM cumene hydroperoxide) and pH stress (pH 4.5)."
