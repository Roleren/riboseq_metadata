abstract
80S ribosomes of S.cerevisiae carry G2400A mutation in the 25S rRNA which makes them sensitive to macrolide antibiotics Overall design: Ribosome profiling was performed on the G2400A mutant S.cerevisiae cells (2 biological replicates) and compared to the same cells treated with telithromycin (2 biological replicates)
