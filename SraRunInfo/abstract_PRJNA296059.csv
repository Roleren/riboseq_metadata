abstract
"RNA sequencing protocols allow for quantifying gene expression regulation at each individual step, from transcription to protein synthesis. Ribosome Profiling (Ribo-seq) maps the positions of translating ribosomes over the entire transcriptome. Despite its great potential, a rigorous statistical approach to identify translated regions from Ribo-seq data is not yet available. To fill this gap, we developed RiboTaper, which quantifies the significance of the three-nucleotide periodicity of Ribo-seq reads via spectral analysis methods. Overall design: Examination of RNA fragments protected by ribosome"
