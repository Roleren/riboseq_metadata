abstract
"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most important internal messenger RNA (mRNA) modification in mammals. The role of Mettl3, the core component of methyltransferase, and Fto, the demethylase, has not been revealed in the embryonic development of the cerebral cortex in mice. We constructed the conditional knockout of Mettl3 and Fto in the cerebral cortex of mice. We found that Mettl3 deletion causes cell cycle extension of progenitors and massive proliferation of intermediate progenitors at E15.5, which lead to a fold structure of cortex, while Fto deletion hardly altered cell numbers or morphology. Meanwhile, both transcriptome sequence (RNA-Seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) of Mettl3-deleted cortex mRNAs in E15.5 revealed that the differential genes were enriched in cell differentiation, neurogenesis, neuron differentiation, cell proliferation, and cell cycle. Moreover, deleted Mettl3 but not Fto significantly upregulated Ythdf1 and Ythdf2, which caused a substantial change in gene translation efficiency. Our findings indicate cortex m6A represents a novel layer of complexity in gene expression regulation and provide a new mechanism of precisely programmed RNA maturation. Overall design: RNA-SEQ and Ribo-SEQ of the cerebral cortex of Emx1-Cre: Mettl3flox/flox and Emx1-Cre: Ftoflox/flox mice at E15.5"
