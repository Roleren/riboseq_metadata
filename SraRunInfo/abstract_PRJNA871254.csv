"Purpose: To systematically investigate the molecular mechanisms resulting from Mycn loss-of-function. Methods:  Approximately 30 mycn mutant or WT zebrafish embryos at 72 hpf (hours post fertilization) were harvested . Libraries were prepared using Chromium Controller and Chromium Single Cell 3'Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, PN-1000074) according to the manufacturer's protocol for 10000 cells recovery. Results: More than 3,000 genes showed reduced tranlation efficiency in Mycn mutant. Conclusions: mTOR signaling was reduced in Mycn mutant. Overall design: wild-type or mycn zebrafish embryos at 72 hpf were harvested for RNA-seq and Ribo-seq."
