abstract
Heterologous gene expression to expand the native genetic capability of E. coli is the backbone of protein expression and metabolic engineering. The goal of this study was to determine how the identity of the heterologous gene expressed affected the host cell transcriptome. We generated a library of E. coli expressing 46 heterologous genes through an identical rhamnose inducible expression system and perform high throughput ribosome profiling. Overall design: Ribosome profiling of 46 heterologous gene expressing lines of E. coli using the same expression system
