"NIH-3T3 cells were infected with wildtype MCMV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Ribosome profiling was performed at the indicated times of infection as described in Rutkowski et al., Nature Communications 2015. Overall design: Ribosome profiling was performed at 0 and 48 h post infection. Two biological replicates were analysed."
