abstract
"RPL3L is a ribosomal protein expressed exclusively in adult straited muscle tissues, and a paralogue of the ubiquitously expressed RPL3. Here, we are looking into the effects of Rpl3l knockout on translation in adult mice hearts. Overall design: Ribo-SEQ and RNA-seq done on WT and Rpl3l-/- mouse hearts in biological triplicates."
