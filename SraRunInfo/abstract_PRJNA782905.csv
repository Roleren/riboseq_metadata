"Key protein adapters couple translation to mRNA decay on specific classes of problematic mRNAs in eukaryotes. Slow decoding on nonoptimal codons leads to codon-optimality-mediated decay (COMD) and prolonged arrest at stall sites leads to no-go decay (NGD). The identities of the decay factors underlying these processes and the mechanisms by which they respond to translational distress remain open areas of investigation. We use carefully-designed reporter mRNAs to perform genetic screens and functional assays in S. cerevisiae. We characterize the roles of Hel2 and Syh1 in coordinating translational repression and mRNA decay on NGD reporter mRNAs, finding that Syh1 acts as the primary link to mRNA decay in NGD. Importantly we, observe that these NGD factors are not involved in the degradation of mRNAs enriched in nonoptimal codons. Further, we establish that key factors previously implicated in COMD, Not5 and Dhh1 , contribute modestly to the degradation of an NGD-targeted mRNA. Finally, we use ribosome profiling to reveal distinct ribosomal states associated with each reporter mRNA that readily rationalize the contributions of NGD and COMD factors to degradation of these reporters. Taken together, these results provide new mechanistic insight into the role of Syh1 in NGD and define the molecular triggers that determine how distinct pathways target mRNAs for degradation in yeast. Overall design: Monosome and disome footprint profiling was performed on yeast strains containing one of three different translation reporters (minOPT, minNONOPT, or minCGA) and in one of three different genetic backgrounds (wild-type, hel2? and syh1?). Two or three replicates per reporter/background pair were performed."
