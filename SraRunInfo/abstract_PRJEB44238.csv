abstract
"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease can be caused by mutations in Aminoacyl-tRNA-Synthetases, including G240R mutation in Glycyl-tRNA-Synthetase (GARS). Ribo-seq generates snapshots of translating ribosomes on mRNA and therefore allows analysis of ribosome pausing mRNA. Here we performed Ribo-seq on lysates of HEK293T cells overexpressing GARS, WT or G240R, to dissect mechanism of CMT linked with translation. We found that GARS G240R causes pausing of ribosomes with glycine codons in A-site. The effect is specific for 21 nt ribosome-protected fragments, produced by ribosomes with empty A-sites, suggestive of the deficit of charged Glycyl-tRNA in GARS G240R-CMT."
