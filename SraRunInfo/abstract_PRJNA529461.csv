abstract
"A sequencing-based profiling method (RiboMeth-seq) for ribose methylations was used to study methylation patterns in mouse adult tissues and during development. In contrast to previous reports based on studies of human cancer cell lines, almost all methylation sites were close to fully methylated in adult tissues. A subset of sites was differentially modified in developing tissues compared to their adult counterparts and showed clear developmental dynamics. This provides the first evidence for ribosome heterogeneity at the level of rRNA modifications during mouse development. In a prominent example, the expression levels of SNORD78 during development appeared to be regulated by alternative splicing of the Gas5 host-gene and to correlate with the methylation level of its target site at LSU-G4593. The results are discussed in the context of the specialized ribosome hypothesis. Overall design: 11 samples analyzed in biological triplicates, in total 33 samples"
