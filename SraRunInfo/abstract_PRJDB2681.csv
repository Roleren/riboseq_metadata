"CAGEscan sequencing of the ribosome-associated RNA in rat Purkinje neurons in different subcellular compartments (cytoplasmic and membrane-bound compartments of the cell body and of dendrites) and two different conditions (control, induced long-term-depression). This dataset describes expression values together with precise 5'' transcription start sites in different subcellular compartments of rat Purkinje neurons. We used a mosaic AAV2/2-8 virus to introduce an EYFP-RPL10a construct specifically into Purkinje cells. The EYFP-tagged ribosomes were pulled-down together with all associated RNA, and then sequenced using the CAGEscan protocol [Plessy, C. et al. Linking promoters to functional transcripts in small samples with nanoCAGE and CAGEscan. Nature methods 7, 528-534 (2010)]. In addition RNA from the entire slice, without pull-down, was sequenced to enable a comparison of Purkinje-specific and nonspecific transcripts in the cerebellum."
