abstract
"Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) is a powerful method for the transcriptome-wide assessment of protein synthesis rates and the study of translational control mechanisms. Yet, Ribo-seq also has limitations. These include difficulties with detection of low abundance transcripts and analysis of translation-modulating molecules such as antibiotics, which are often toxic or challenging to deliver into living cells. Here, we have developed in vitro Ribo-seq (INRI-seq), a cell-free method to analyze the translational landscape of a fully customizable synthetic transcriptome. Using Escherichia coli as an example, we show how INRI-seq can be used to analyze the translation initiation sites of a transcriptome of interest. We also study the global impact of direct translation inhibition by antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) to analyze PNA off-target effects. Overall, INRI-seq presents a scalable, sensitive method to study translation initiation in a transcriptome-wide manner without the potentially confounding effects of extracting ribosomes from living cells. Overall design: Examination of control and PNA-treated samples of different concentrations before applying INRI-Seq"
