abstract
"Oocyte-to-embryo transition plays a critical role in oocyte maturation and embryogenesis. It is a highly regulated process in part due to a transcription silenced period followed by zygotic genome activation. How transcriptome, translatome, and proteome interplay in this critical developmental window remains poorly understood. Utilizing a highly sensitive mass spectrometry, we obtained a high-quality proteome landscape spanning 10 stages, from the mouse full-grown oocyte (FGO) to blastocyst, using 100 oocytes/embryos at each stage. By integrative analysis with corresponding transcriptome and translatome, we found transcription and translation levels can not reflect protein abundance in most cases. From FGO to 4-cell embryos, proteomes are predominated by FGO-produced proteins, while the transcriptome and translatome are much more dynamic. FGO inherited proteins frequently persist after the corresponding transcripts are already downregulated or decayed. Improved concordance between protein and RNA is observed for genes starting translation only upon meiotic resumption (OET upregulated) or transcribed only in embryos, although the detected protein dynamics often lag behind transcription and translation. Concordance between protein and transcription/tranlation is associated with protein half-lives. Finally, a kinetic model well predicts protein dynamics when incorporating both the initial protein abundance in FGO and translation kinetics across developmental stages. In sum, our study reveals multilayer control of gene expression during oocyte maturation and embryogenesis. Overall design: By employing RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, and LC-MS/MS across 10 developmental stages from FGO to blastocyst, we investigated the protein, translation and transcription dynamics during oocyte maturation and early embryo development. We also invetigated the interplay between proteome and translatome or transcriptome."
