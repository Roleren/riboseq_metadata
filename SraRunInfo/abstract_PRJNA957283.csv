abstract
"Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are one of the most conserved components of protein synthesis machinery. An effective strategy for microbes to defend against viruses or competitors is to employ anticodon nucleases (ACNases) to deplete essential tRNAs and thereby shut off global protein synthesis, but this strategy has not been observed in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we report that human SAMD9 is a virus-activatable ACNase that specifically depletes phenylalanine tRNA (tRNAPhe), causing codon-specific ribosomal pausing and inducing stress signaling. SAMD9 ACNase can be activated by poxvirus infection or by SAMD9 mutations associated with a spectrum of developmental or immunological disorders, implicating tRNAPhe deficiency as a major toxic effect in these human diseases and suggesting a new therapeutic strategy. The specificity of the ACNase, located to an N-terminal effector domain of SAMD9, is largely determined by a eukaryotic tRNAPhe specific 2'-O-methylation at the wobble position, making eukaryotic tRNAPhe a universal but specific target for SAMD9. The SAMD9 ACNase differs from the microbial ACNases in structure and substrate specificity, suggesting convergent evolution resulted in a universal immune defense strategy targeting tRNAs. Overall design: tRNA-seq, Ribo-seq and RNA-seq. For tRNA-seq, HeLa cells were uninfected or infected with either WT or vK1-C7- VACV for 8 hours. tRNAs were isolated from total RNAs resolved on a denaturing gel, untreated or treated with a tRNA demethylase and subjected to tRNA-seq. For Ribo-seq and RNA-seq,  BT20 cells transduced with SAMD9-R1293W were uninduced or induced for SAMD9-R1293W expression."
