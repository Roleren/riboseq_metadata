abstract
"To examine the protein-coding potential of transcripts, we performed ribosomal profiling analysis. We compared the RNA-seq and ribosomal protected fragments profiles (Ribo-seq) in the ventral part of telenchephalon, hypothalamus and pituitary by deep sequencing. Overall design: Compasison of RNA-seq and Ribo-seq profiles in the ventral part of telenchephalon, hypothalamus and pituitary in medaka."
