"While BCL11A protein is not well synthesized at these earlier stages of development, its mRNA curiously continues to be associated with ribosomes. Through unbiased proteomic analyses in erythroid cells, we demonstrate that the RNA-binding protein LIN28B, which is developmentally expressed in a reciprocal pattern to BCL11A, directly interacts with ribosomes. We show that the observed suppression of BCL11A protein translation is mediated by LIN28B through a direct interaction with BCL11A mRNA and independent of its role in let-7 microRNA biogenesis. Finally, we show that BCL11A is the major functional target in LIN28B-mediated fetal hemoglobin induction. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated regulatory mechanism underlying human hemoglobin switching and illuminate opportunities for developing improved treatments for sickle cell disease and Beta-thalassemia Overall design: Four replicates of ribosome profiling in adult and newborn erythroid cells with matching RNA-seq per sample."
