"In the ribosome complex, tRNA is a critical element of mRNA translation. We reported a new technology for profiling ribosome-embedded tRNAs and their modifications. With the method, we generated a comprehensive survey of the quanity and quality of intra-ribosomal tRNAs (Ribo-tRNA-seq). Ribo-tRNA-seq can provide new insights on translation control mechanism in diverse biological contexts."
